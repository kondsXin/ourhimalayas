**Why should we train our brains?**

Hu Shi talked about this issue when he delivered a speech at the Purdue University graduation ceremony in the United States in 1941.

He believed that a person with a trained mind will be critical and objective when making observations, based on relevant knowledge and learning.

He will not be swayed by prejudice and personal interest. He remains curious. He will not simply trust authority and experts. And he will not jump  to conclusions. And he will not easily follow the opinions of others. He can think independently, judge objectively, and reason systematically.

You might perhaps think that Hu Shi’s view is too academic and unfounded…most people are exhausted and busy with their livelihoods every day. How can there be so much idle time to train their brains? As far as they are concerned, it is not their business to be able to think independently, judge objectively and reason systematically.

Say if training the brain can save lives at critical moments, would you still think it is not important? Look at the many suffocated office workers on the Zhengzhou subway, the corpses in the Beijing-Guangzhou tunnel, and the people all over the world lining up to receive the deadly poisonous injection. Do you still think that training your brain doesn’t matter?

The best self-rescue is to try not to let yourself fall into desperation. It is to actively break the window before the subway is flooded, to escape as soon as possible before the tunnel is inundated. When the media, government, and high-tech biological companies are devastatingly propagating poisonous injections. Bravely resist…sniff out danger and avoid risks early.

**So, how do we train our brains?**

1. **Know your own personality and accept your own “uniqueness”.**

——Often, it is not you who have the problem, but the surrounding environment. For example, in “The Emperor’s New Clothes”, when everyone is lying and pandering to power, the sincerity in you will confront the surrounding environment. At this time, can you remain true to yourself?

Keep your own personality, do not follow the crowd, do not follow the trend, keep a clear, rational, and objective analysis at all times. When personality conflicts with practicality, give your personality the space it deserves.

Cherish your personality. It is the foundation of innovation. The mediocrity of a group is composed of a number of mediocre individuals. Maintaining your personality may make you a “heresy”, but this is precisely what distinguishes you from everyone else.

**2. A person should have a career as well as an interest.**

——Interest will make your life more interesting and happier. British philosopher Mill, was the secretary of the East India Company; another philosopher Spencer, was a survey engineer; politician Churchill was accomplished in literature and history…

Interest is the best teacher. It will steer you towards using your brain and enjoying the process while you are at it.

Use your own interests to prepare yourself for those  “odd and gruelling diseases”, and try to find solutions. Constantly build on your ability to solve problems.

**3. Embark routinely on knowledge training and persistently increase your knowledge reserve.**

—— Hu Shi said in a 1926 Chinese public school’s 18th grade graduation speech: “Don’t abandon your knowledge. Read 10 pages of worthy  books every day. In one year you would have read 3650 pages. In 30 years ,110,000 pages.”

A wealth of knowledge reserves puts you on a certain level when looking at problems, and when making judgments and providing feasible solutions which are based on theoretical foundations

Knowledge is a tool for training the brain, and abandoning knowledge destroys the brain.

**4. Preserve your curiosity and desires to explore the unknown world.**

——The demise of the ancient Roman Empire certainly had military, political, and religious reasons. Nonetheless, the imperial nobles were not enterprising, lacked curiosity, and there was a lack of exploration in unknown areas…more key reasons for the empire’s decline —— The upper class at that time wandered around the Colosseum partaking in banquets, engaging in blackmail and profiteering. They had no interest in understanding the international environment of the times, nor did they want to explore the mysteries of the ocean. Even the supplies of medicine and doctors were entrusted to Greek slaves.

They never did understand: innovation is productivity and innovation is competitiveness. To buy talents from others is to trample on your own talents.

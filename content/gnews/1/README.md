The Deutsche Welle (DW) Quoted the news from the “Hong Kong Free Press” on September 15th that the Wikimedia Foundation issued a ban on some Chinese users by revoking the login rights of 7 users and the management and editing rights of 12 users because these Chinese users abused their rights and threatened the Hong Kong editors or administrators of Wikipedia by report ing them to the National Security Office of the Hong Kong Police. As soon as the news came out, it caused a wolf-like attack by the Wikimedians of Mainland China (WMC) user group.

The vice president Wikimedia Foundation Dennis said in a statement on Tuesday that Wikipedia had launched an investigation on a group of officially unrecognized Wikimedians of Mainland China (WMC) includes nearly 300 Wikipedia users and identified that this organization existed the security risks of the CCP’s infiltration on the Wikimedia system like accessing to the personal information through their positions and exerting influence on the election mechanism. She also revealed that a part of Wikipedia users have been physically harmed due to the infiltration by the CCP’s user community.

The CCP government has blocked the Wikipedia website since 2019, but a part of related users are still quite active in the Wiki community. Since the Hong Kong’s Anti-ELAB movement in 2019, the Wikipedia editors in Hong Kong and mainland China have had political disagreement on the determination of facts and how to describe the incident. Among the six newly elected administrators of the Chinese Wiki, two are from Hong Kong and one of them has publicly supported the CCP government since 2019 as reported. The Chinese version users used the illegal canvassing against the election violations to ensure the election of the CCP’s administrators.

According to a story in the Mail Online on September 16th, 2021, there are calls for an ‘urgent inquiry’ into the UK’s dependency on China, as it is revealed three out of four of the directors at the Cambridge Centre for Chinese Management (CCCM) have ties to Huawei. British companies and universities had grown ‘far too dependent on Chinese money’ in recent years and added: ‘The government needs to urgently set up an inquiry into the UK’s dependency on China, across a range of institutions and companies.’Huawei is incredibly proud of their relationships with UK universities and any suggestion of impropriety is absurd. All this demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of academic partnerships with businesses from around the world.

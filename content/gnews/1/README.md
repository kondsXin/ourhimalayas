Health Ministry Director-General Nachman Ash said on Tuesday that the current wave of coronavirus infections is surpassing anything seen in previous outbreaks and that he is disappointed at the rebound in the pandemic. After bringing daily infections down in June, the trend ended last week, and the outbreak began to rebound. There is a high rate of vaccination in Israel, with more than 60 percent of the population fully vaccinated. Last month, more than one million people in Israel received their third dose of the vaccine, which made it the most vaccinated country in the world for the third dose. However, the widespread rollout of the vaccine has not stopped the rebound of the outbreak, which has made the fourth wave of infections Israel has experienced.

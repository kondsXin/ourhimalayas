South Korean media reported that on September 13, South Korea and Australia held the fifth “2+2” meeting between the two foreign ministers and defense ministers in Seoul.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Korea and Australia. The two countries are committed to establishing a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. They have discussed the new southern policy/Indo-Pacific strategy/economic and military-industrial cooperation. In addition, the peace process on the Korean Peninsula and multilateral cooperation are also become an issue. The two sides stated that since 2019, the Indo-Pacific region has undergone many major changes, and the factors threatening regional peace and stability continue to increase. Therefore, South Korea and Australia also need to increase their corresponding strength to meet the challenges.

In response to regional threats from China and Russia, including North Korea, the US Congress has recently moved forward to attract four countries, including South Korea, to join the “Five Eyes Alliance.” The talks on the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between South Korea and Australia may accelerate this process.

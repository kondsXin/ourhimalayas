According to a report by Breitbart News on September 15th, 2021, Curtin University of Australia requested the withdrawal of a 2018 research study, which was partly funded by the Chinese Communist regime. Actually, the study conducted by a former Curtin faculty employee, Wanquan Liu, was intended to help the CCP to improve its facial recognition software used to monitor the oppressed Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang Province.

The report also stated that the key problem with this study was that Uyghur university students did not give their consent when they were added to a “dataset of facial images”. Besides, Alibaba, Chinese Tech giant admitted that it also played its role in developing such facial recognition technology in 2020.

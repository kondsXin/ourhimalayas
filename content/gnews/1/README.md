According to a recent investigation report of the “[Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/09/10/revealed-scientists-dismissed-wuhan-lab-theory-linked-chinese/)”, the “Lancet” medical journal, who was the earliest to announce the coronavirus originated from nature, 26 out of the 27 signers have been found to have cooperative relationship with the Wuhan Virology Laboratory.

In March 2020, the “Lancet” published an article that was jointly signed by 27 top virologists from all over the world., announced that the coronavirus was originated from the nature, and define all discussions that the virus can possibly originated from a lab or even artificially made, as conspiracy theories. Among these 27 signers, 26 of them were found to have conflicts of interest with the CCP. Among them, Peter Daszak, the head of the EcoHealth Alliance who lead the composition of the abovementioned article, was closely cooperating with Shi Zhengli who was associated with the Wuhan Laboratory, and was responsible for subsidising the Wuhan Laboratory through the 2018 Global Virome Project for its “Gain of Functions” research, and there are 2 other signer of the article were also members of the project that funded the Wuhan Laboratory.

Farrar, a British tropical disease expert, is the head of the Wellcome Investment Foundation in London. This foundation used to provide funds for the Wuhan Laboratory, and Farrar was closely associated with Gao Fu, the Director of the CCP’s Center of Disease Control and Prevention, and another two scholars who are associated with this foundation, are also on the list. Another example is, Ms. Saif, Ohio’s expert of microbiology, attended the academic seminar organized by the Wuhan Laboratory in May 2017. John Mackenzie, who is from the Curtin University in Australia, still remain as a member of the Scientific Committee of the Wuhan Institute of Infectious Diseases.

This investigation report triggers repercussions in the virology academia. Some scholars say the “Lancet” should withdraw the abovementioned article, and it is shocking that so many authors are associated with the Wuhan Laboratory, but the article did not make any of these information public.

The Whistleblower Movement has long been exposing the CCP’s Blue-Gold-Yellow (BGY) plan and network. These experts have thrown away their own conscience, stood for the CCP because of their own benefits, and helped the CCP to cover up the truth. All these efforts are all in vain. The evident provided by the Whistleblowing Movement has proven to the world that the coronavirus is a bio-weapon manufactured by the CCP. It is a fact that cannot be argued and changed by anyone. In the end, the CCP will be annihilated by the Righteous Forces for creating such virus.

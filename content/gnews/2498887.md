## 视频|畜奴社会
` MOSVIDEO` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/2498887/)

畜奴社会一词是由郭文贵先生在2022年5月1日的大直播时首次提出。
 
The term ”livestock slaves society“ was first raised by Miles Guo during the Grand Live Broadcast on May 1, 2022.
 
他基于中共国内近期以病毒清零为借口的大规模封城造成国人有病不能医，有工不能做，有地不能种，有学不能上，有钱不能花，有车不能开等等乱象。
 
He based this on the recent mass closure of cities in the Communist China on the pretext of “Zero-Covid”, which has resulted in a chaotic situation where people are unable to seek medical treatment, work, plant, study, spend money or drive a car.
 
导致钱在银行取不出，护照在手无法出国，甚至停止一切与出国移民相关的服务；
 
Resulting in money cannot be withdrawn from banks, passport in hand but unable to go abroad, or even the suspension of all services related to immigration abroad.
 
人们被禁闭在家，没吃没喝，只能等政府投食。
 
People were locked inside their homes, without food and water, and had to wait for the government to feed them.
 
深刻地描绘了共产党的邪恶目的，把中共国内的人们视为畜牲不如的奴隶，关在笼子里，没有话语权，
 
Deeply describing the evil aims of the CCP, treating people in the Communist China as slaves worse than animals, locked in cages and without the right to a voice,
 
无法掌控自己的生命及财富，任其奴役剥削，当你无利用价值的时候找各种方法杀死你。
 
people can not control their own lives and wealth, they are enslaved and exploited, and when they are no longer of use, the CCP find ways to kill them.
 
这就是以习近平为首的邪恶共产党梦想实现秦始皇时期的集权统治！把中共国变成畜奴社会。
 
This is the evil CCP, led by Xi Jinping, dreaming of achieving the centralized rule of emperor Qin Shihuang’s period! Turning the Communist China into a society of livestock slaves.

2022年5月2日，妮可战友在梅迪卡难民营采访了一对来自俄罗斯的义工母子。
 
On May 2, 2022, fellow fighter Nicole interviewed two Russian mother and son volunteers who came from Russia at the Medyka refugee camp.
 
母亲西尼亚出生于莫斯科，后来嫁到英国。
 
The mother, Synia, was born in Moscow and later married in England.
 
他们是在不久前逃离莫斯科，来到梅迪卡难民营做救援义工的，
 
They had fled from Moscow to Medica refugee camp a short time earlier to work as rescue volunteers.
 
母子俩都是俄乌战争的反对者。
 
Both mother and son are opponents of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
 
西尼亚在采访中告诉妮可，在俄罗斯很多人是反对普京侵略乌克兰战争的，
 
In the interview, Synia told Nicole that there are many people in Russia who are against Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
 
但在独裁政府统治下，俄罗斯人不敢公开表达自己的反战立场和对乌克兰人民的支持，
 
But under the dictatorship, Russians are afraid to openly express their anti-war stance and support for the Ukrainian people.
 
她的很多朋友就因参加反战和平抗议而被捕或失去工作。
 
Many of her friends have been arrested or lost their jobs just for participating in peaceful anti-war protests.
 
因此她决定与儿子紧急逃离莫斯科，并直接抵达梅迪卡救援前线帮助乌克兰难民。
 
For this reason, she decided to urgently flee Moscow with her son and go directly to the Medyka rescue front to help the refugees coming to Ukraine.
 
她还透露，和他们想法一致的一群人中，有的在乌克兰边境，有的在火车站，
 
She also revealed that a group of people who shared their thoughts were either at the Ukrainian border or at the railway station.
 
他们宁愿在国外艰难谋生也要逃离俄罗斯，即便在生活陷入困境，甚至绝境的情况下，依然愿意到前线帮助乌克兰人。
 
They would rather live a hard life abroad than flee Russia. Even when they are in a difficult, even desperate situation in their lives, they are still willing to go to the front line and participate in rescue operations to help Ukrainians.
 
西尼亚对自己何时能返回俄罗斯的家感到担忧，
 
Synia says she doesn’t know when she will be able to return back to Russia home
 
因为普京政府跟中共政府一样时刻关注着人们的言论及其在社交媒体上发表的观点，随时对当事人进行打压甚至拘捕。
 
because Putin’s government, like the Chinese Communist government, is constantly watching what people say and the views they express on social media and is ready to suppress or even arrest those involved.
 
持俄罗斯护照的19岁儿子尼基塔算是半个英国人。
 
Nikita, the 19-year-old son of a Russian passport holder, is considered half-British.
 
战争开始时，他正在充满极权统治恐怖氛围的莫斯科参加反战和平抗议，被无处不在的武装警察追得满街跑，并被要求参军入伍对乌克兰作战。
 
At the start of the war, he was taking part in peaceful anti-war protests in Moscow, which was filled with the horrors of totalitarian rule, being chased through the streets by the ubiquitous armed police and being asked to enlist in the army to fight against Ukraine.
 
因此，他不得不匆忙跟母亲一起逃离莫斯科，
 
As a result, he had to flee Moscow in a hurry with his mother.
 
并决定直接来到这里尽己所能帮助乌克兰人，用自己的行动表明并不是每个俄罗斯人都支持普京的这场战争。
 
They decided to come straight here and do what they can to help the Ukrainians. They showed by their actions that not every Russian supports Putin in this war.
 
妮可表示这也正是我们逃离共产主义中国的新中国联邦人正在做的事情，
 
Nicole says that’s exactly what we, the New Chinese of NFSC, who fled communist China, are doing.
 
我们鼓足勇气冒着生命危险站出来反对并推翻中国共产党，
 
We have gathered the courage to risk our lives to stand up against and overthrow the Communist Party of China.
 
我们不能被为普京政府提供军事和经济支援的习共所代表，
 
We cannot be represented by the Xi Communist government that provides military and financial support to Putin’s government.
 
唯有拥抱自由、民主和法治的新中国联邦才能代表真正的中国人。
 
Only the New Federal State of China (NFSC,) which embraces freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, can represent the true Chinese people.
 
因此我们和你们一样来到这里帮助乌克兰人民并与他们站在一起，为独裁专制下的国内同胞发声，
 
That is why we are here, like you, to help the Ukrainian people and stand with them, to give a voice to our compatriots who are under the dictatorship in Communist China,
 
告诉世界我们热爱和平反对这场战争。
 
And to tell the world that we love peace and are against this war.
 
西尼亚对见到中国人在这里做义工支持乌克兰人表示很惊讶，
 
Synia was surprised to see Chinese people volunteering here and supporting Ukrainians.
 
为新中国联邦人的勇气鼓掌，并因习共卷入这场战争而为中国人民感到担心。
 
She applauded the courage of the New Chinese of NFSC and worried for the Communist Chinese people because of Xi’s involvement in this war at the same time.
 
尼基塔发自内心地认为新中国联邦人所做的事情非常重要，并为我们喝彩。
 
Nikita thought from the bottom of his heart that what the New Chinese of NFSC are doing is very important and applauded us.
 
妮可为这对俄罗斯母子的立场表示感同身受，并给予支持和赞赏，称他们代表了真正的俄罗斯人。
 
Nicole expressed her empathy, support, and appreciation for the Russian mother and son, saying they represent the true Russians.

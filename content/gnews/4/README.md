According to data from Public Health England, 70 per cent of COVID-19, or Chinese Communist Party (CCP) deaths from February 2021 to the end of August this year were from the nation’s vaccinated population.

According to the British alternative media outlet The Exposé, Britain’s mainstream media, public health sources, and government include deaths from January 2021 (when barely anyone in the UK had been vaccinated) in their recent COVID-19 death reports.

Meanwhile, official data from Scotland shows 179 deaths were recorded across the country from 5th August 2021 to 2nd September 2021. However, in the same period last year, three COVID-19 deaths were recorded across the entire population.

“This means COVID-19 deaths across Scotland are currently 5,866.66% / 58.6 times higher than they were this time last year, despite the majority of the population of being vaccinated and summer being on their side,” notes The Exposé.

Furthermore, COVD-19 statistics from Public Health Scotland reveal that around 15,000 more positive cases were discovered among the vaccinated in Scotland compared to the unvaccinated population.

“Public Health Scotland are trying to hide the fact the majority of deaths are among the vaccinated due to the date parameters they have used to publish deaths by vaccination status. The deaths stretch back as far as the 29th December,” stated The Exposé.

“This means they are including deaths from the [height of the alleged second wave of Covid-19](https://www.google.com/search?q=covid-19+deaths+scotland&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB812GB812&amp;oq=covid-19+deaths+scotland)where [just 9% of the population had received a single dose, and just 0.1% of the entire population were fully vaccinate](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=GBR)d.”

A  comparison between table 17 of Public Health Scotland’s COVID-19 death reports shows that unvaccinated deaths account for 21.7 per cent of all Scotland’s COVID-19 deaths since 5th August 2021, while the vaccinated population accounted for 78.3 per cent of COVID-19 deaths since the same date.

According to this table, the majority of COVID-19 deaths, dated from December 2020 to August 2021, appear to be from the unvaccinated population.

However, according to this table dating from December 2020 to September 2021, most deaths from August 2021 to September 2021 were among the vaccinated, especially those with two doses.

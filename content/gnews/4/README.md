After reading an incredible story in the Easton Spectator on September 12th, 2021, it brings to everyone’s attention the writing of an open letter, and this letter was written by a group of extremely concerned health professionals from British Columbia. The Open Letter was directed to Dr. Bonnie Henry, Adrian Dix and British Columbia Premier John Horgan. The letter states that there are many un-answered critical questions specifically about the current reporting of case numbers, statistics and testing.

The letter continues to say that there is a total lack of transparency regarding the effectiveness and safety of the experimental vaccines, and this lack of transparency has led to a far more divisive society, with even families and friends finding themselves on the opposite side of the argument.

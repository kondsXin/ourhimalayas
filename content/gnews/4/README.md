COVID-19 is a hot topic for everyone in the world, and so are COVID vaccination. There have been countless protests happened globally opposing vaccine mandates including Canada, United England, Italy, France, etc. Even people in the United States have been very frustrating and gathering in a difference state for the anti-vaccine protest. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved or authorized COVID vaccinesPfizer, Moderna, and Janssen under Emergency Use Authorization (EAU). Although the fully vaccinated people against COVID-19 rate in the US is showing an uptrend, according to the surveillance data reported by jurisdictions to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 cases and deaths are showing an uptrend as well (Figure 1).Are these EAU vaccines not highly effective enough or have these fully vaccinated people lost their natural immunity and infected by the variant virus?

Two forces that control everything are order and chaos(Zelenko. 2021). Anti-COVID vaccines were supposed to keep people safe, healthy, and well-being. However, COVID vaccination mandates have led to chaos in many western countries; COVID vaccination mandates have led our society to uncertain their trust in the government. Balance of order and chaos leads to peace and unbalanced chaos is pathologic and leads to communist totalitarianism. During the pandemic crisis, I think it’s significant that decision-makers or lawmakers having a framework for ethical decision making and making ethical decisions requires sensitivity to the ethical implications of problems and situations.

I believe that “one long-standing ethical principle argues that ethical actions should be consistent with ideal human virtues” (Brown University, 2013). COVID vaccine is meant to be saving lives which is one of the ideal human virtues. Witness the existing worldwide anti-vaccine protests movements, whether governments are properly held under ethical standards of conduct?“The question of whether governments are properly held under ethical standards of conductmay be divided into questions of external relations (between governments) and internal relations (between a government and its people)” (Hare, J. E. 2001).

Ethics in society is directly related to our personal, organizational, and national interests. The ethical standards of national security affairs are based on the ethics of individuals and organizations. Because of the interest-relationship existing within these three, it maysometimes affect the decision-making at each level and each group. A wrong decision made between individuals or organizations could lead to broken relationships or lost faith among them. And an unwise decision made could be potentially put our nation in danger. In other words, we ought not to deceive others, not to inflict harm or risk of harm to others instead, we should always respect and treat others as we want to be treated and work together as a team to secure our country.

Extracting the best potential of order and chaos leads to redemption. Integrating the energy of chaos into the stability of order is also redemption (Zelenko. 2021). I support the COVID vaccine is only provided to the people as need and as their will. I raise my voice to urge governments to stop vaccination mandates to their own citizens, especially to the United States military personnel.

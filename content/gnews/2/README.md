On September 15, China Daily cited news by CCTV that Communist China’s Ministry of Education issued a dire warning titled “Notice on further efforts to contain the (Covid) epidemic during the fall semester and mid-autumn festival/National Day holidays.” All local education departments and schools are required to strictly prevent epidemic outbreaks on campus. The notice also encourages routine or irregular PCR virus tests for all or some of the employees in border areas and inland areas with high influx of visitors from abroad.

Wang Dengfeng, director of the Education Ministry’s task force office to contain Covid pneumonia, stated that currently in Communist China’s education system, “the ratio of teachers, students and employees over 18 years old who have received two doses of vaccination exceeds 95%, and the same is true for the age group 12-17. The current nationwide vaccination rate is about 91%.”

In terms of its function, inoculation is to build an immunity barrier. Communist China’s “hero to contain the epidemic” Zhong Nanshan (an expert in disease control) previously announced to the media in June this year, “If the protection rate of vaccine is estimated to be around 70%, a vaccination rate of 80% of the population or more is necessary for our country before an immunity barrier is established.” Judging by Zhong Nanshan’s hypothesis, the current ratio of two-dose vaccination in the education system has far exceeded the 80% that is required to build an immunity barrier. By this reasoning, the immunity barrier in the education system has been solidly built and should have been more than enough to deal with the Covid epidemic. This remark reveals the Chinese Communist Party’s hypocrisy on vaccines: given such a high vaccination rate in China, why are they panicking over potential infection clusters on school campuses if their vaccines are effective?

In addition, according to news the from finance section of china.com on September 16, Huang Zhenglong, deputy director of the Disease Control Bureau in Communist China’s National Health Commission, made an announcement at a press conference hosted on the same day by the Joint Disease Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council. “As of September 15, the entire China has reported a total of more than 2.16 billion doses of Covid vaccine injections, and more than 1 billion people have completed full vaccination,” Huang said. Communist China’s official data indicate China currently has a population of 1.41 billion. According to the figures above, 71% of China’s population are fully vaccinated currently, and 82% of the population have received at least one jab.

As shown by the data above, the immunity barrier outside the education system is also close to completion. Communist China has always touted their success in containing Covid domestically—they claimed new infections are caused by imports from overseas. By inference, as long as the customs office controls the flow of visitors from abroad, the education system does not need to be “battle-ready” to deal with the epidemic. Even if the virus is occasionally brought on school campuses, will the “immunity barrier” of 90% vaccination be ineffective?

As the mid-autumn festival and National Day are around the corner, Wang Dengfeng also indicated that the Education Ministry encourages teachers and students to celebrate the festivals at their local areas and not to travel into other areas unless necessary. This is reminiscent of this year’s Spring Festival when the CCP government took various measures to keep migrant workers from traveling during the holidays to prevent large-scale outbreaks of the epidemic.

So, is the warning notice from the Education Ministry “unnecessary,” or is it an indirect admission that the vaccine immunity barrier touted by the CCP government has completely failed?

In an article published by the Daily Mail.com on September 13th, 2021, Chinese tech firm Huawei has ‘infiltrated’ a university research centre in the UK– the Cambridge Centre for Chinese Management (CCCM). It was revealed that three out of four directors at this centre have ties to Huawei, the Chinese tech giant.

Critics in the UK call for an ‘urgent inquiry’ into the country’s dependency on China, not only in Cambridge but across a range of institutions and companies in the UK that had grown ‘far too dependent on Chinese money’ in recent years.

Cambridge University has been described as ‘one of the worst offenders’ when it came to relying on money from China and becoming a ‘mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party.

Huawei, which has been banned from joining Britain’s 5G network over national security concerns, has denied any impropriety of its doing aforementioned.

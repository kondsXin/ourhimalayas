Curtin University has urged publisher Wiley to retract a research paper written by Wanquan Liu, a former Associate Professor of the university. His research, published in 2018, helped the CCP better identify Uyghurs using facial recognition technology. Curtin University found he breached several ethical codes, including a failure to obtain informed consent and approval.

Facial Recognition Technology is widely utilized in Communist China, and it has penetrated the daily life of ordinary people. People’s lives have become completely “transparent” because they do not have any privacy. The CCP monitors every move of everyone through facial recognition and surveillance devices everywhere at all times. Although the CCP issued a draft of the Personal Information Protection Act, it is a total lie. Instead, they want to turn China into a digital totalitarian state as described in the novel *1984* –– the big brother is watching you at all times and knows everything.

Liu’s paper, which the Curtin University demands Wiley to withdraw, was only a tip of the iceberg involving the CCP’s infringement of the human right of the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The CCP is well-known for imprisoning, surveillance, and mass-murdering the Uyghurs in Xinjiang in the name of fighting terrorism. They have committed the crime of genocide against humanity. Facial recognition technology is only a tool they use to conduct their crime.

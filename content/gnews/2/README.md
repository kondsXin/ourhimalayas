Japan’s Defense Ministry announced on Sept. 12 that a submarine believed to be from Communist China was spotted by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force last Friday morning (Sept. 10) in waters near Amami Oshima island, part of Kagoshima prefecture, as maritime tensions persist in the Pacific. The submarine was sailing northwest at the time.  A Chinese destroyer was also spotted in the vicinity.

The announcement said Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force spotted the vessels in a contiguous zone, which required them to identify themselves by international practice. The statement said Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi instructed his staff to gather and maintain vigilant surveillance with a sense of urgency.

Recently, there have been numerous intrusions by Communist Chinese vessels of its territorial waters and near disputed islands, constantly creating tension in the Pacific. Wang Yi warned that unilateral actions that could complicate and magnify the disputes should be avoided in the South China Sea during his recent visit to Vietnam.

And at the same time, Vietnam quickly reached an arms trade agreement with Japan, leading to discontent and retaliatory behavior by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP’s military provocations near Japan’s territorial waters have only accelerated Japan’s more conscious awareness of the CCP’s threat.

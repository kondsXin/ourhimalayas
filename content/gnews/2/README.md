According to the Daily Mail, on Monday, thousands of teachers marched across the Brooklyn Bridge to protest against mandatory vaccinations near the New York City Hall. The protesters chanted slogans condemning President Biden’s vaccination policy, then they gathered for a rally in Manhattan’s Foley Square.

The demonstration was initiated by a teacher group that opposed the mandatory vaccine policy. The Mayor of New York asked public school teachers to get at least one dose of vaccine or to be fired by September 27. At the same time, New York City also orders bars, restaurants, and gyms to implement mandatory vaccination policies on Monday.

At present, protests and demonstrations against the vaccine enforcement policy are taking place around the world. Not only is this policy violating human rights, but it has also begun to tear apart society and even families. As the side effects of the vaccine gradually appear, it will definitely have a knock-on effect on the global political, economic and social pattern.

According to Mr. Miles Guo’s live broadcast on September 14, the SEC case that lasted for nearly a year has reached a final settlement. The Whistleblowers’ Movement not only guarantees its fastest efficiency, but also ensures the interests of all individual and institutional investors. This will become the benchmark in the world finance field as well as reveal falseness, deception, and BGY(Blue-Gold-Yellow) Plan of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

After the investigation by the SEC, it was confirmed that the previous report was a deception by the CCP spies but GTV did everything legally. The VOG’s 2,700 comrades only violated the registration exemption regulations required by the Securities Law. Mr. Miles Guo took all the responsibility in order to guarantee the safety and interests of every comrade. He also engaged a team of dozens of lawyers, spent a large amount of time as well as nearly 20 million dollars in lawyer fees, and achieved the historic beneficial settlement to all investors within a year. Whether it is the extreme bureaucracy and corruption of the SEC or the manipulation of the CCP refraining from notifying the parties, they sent the information to the Wall Street Journal through its cooperating units for the purpose of creating a “headline effect.”

No matter the Financial Times or Bloomberg spreads false information and defames GTV throughout the world, Mr. Miles Guo said that publicity has brought an advertising effect worth at least 160 to 200 million dollars to the G series. Meanwhile, the CCP fabricated that case, threatened the Whistleblower comrade-in-arms inside China, and used BGY on the relevant departments of the U.S., which cost at least 500 million dollars. They attempted to sue Mr. Miles Guo with crimes of fraud and let investors lose confidence in Mr. Guo intentionally to destroy the opportunity for the G series to enter the U.S. market. Nevertheless, the whole financial world has recognized that Mr. Miles Guo did not cheat anyone and took all risks and responsibility. Overnight, it is not only Mr. Guo’s reputation that has increased, but also the Whistleblowers’ Movement and the G series that obtained great prestige around the world.

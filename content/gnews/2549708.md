4月27日，妮可采访到一名来自乌克兰首都基辅的义工女孩。
 
On April 27th, Nicole interviewed a volunteer, a girl from the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv.
 
她是亲历了战争的残酷、目睹了家园的被毁，几经波折后来到梅迪卡救援基地做义工的。
 
She had seen the brutality of war and the destruction of her home, and came to Medyca to volunteer at the relief camp after a few twists and turns.
 
她讲述到，战争开始前，当普京坚称卢甘斯克等地是俄罗斯领土而拒绝谈判时，她就料到战争很可能会发生，便及早开始打包，为自己和宠物的离开作了必要的准备。
 
She told that before the war began, when Putin insisted that places such as Luhansk were Russian territory and refused to negotiate, she anticipated that war was likely to occur and began packing early to make the necessary preparations for herself and her pets to leave.
 
战争的第一天，在没有任何战争预告的情况下，突如其来的俄军轰炸声震惊了乌克兰和全世界。
 
On the first day of the war, without any forewarning at all, the sudden sound of Russian bombardment shocked Ukraine and the world.
 
那天早上5点钟，她就被附近的炮弹爆炸声惊醒，但直到2小时后才看到有关战争的新闻。
 
She was woken up by the sound of shells exploding nearby at 5 o’clock that morning, but did not see the news about the war until two hours later.
 
惊魂未定的她，来不及多想，带上宠物和行李立刻赶往住在基辅另一边的父母家。
 
She was too stunned to think much about it, taking her pets and luggage immediately and rushing to her parents’ home on the other side of Kyiv.
 
在战火下，她与父母住了一个月的时间，亲眼目睹了火箭弹和炸弹在身边的爆炸和对建筑的摧毁，
 
For a month, she lived with her parents under the fire of war, witnessed the rockets and bombs exploding around them and the destruction of buildings,
 
其中最危险的一次是去附近的一个银行取钱，差点被炸弹炸伤，家里的玻璃和镜子都被震得粉碎。
 
One of the most dangerous times was when she went to a nearby bank to withdraw money, and was almost injured by a bomb that shocked the glass and mirrors to pieces in her home.
 
她告诉妮可最害怕的并不是战争本身，而是俄军对基辅及其周边地区毁灭性的破坏，将自己在这个城市的童年记忆无情而彻底地抹去。
 
She told Nicole that what she feared most was not the war itself, but the devastating destruction of Kyiv and its surroundings by the Russian army, which would mercilessly and completely erase her childhood memories of the city.
 
乌克兰人民只是想过平静、与世无争的生活，和平地建设自己的家园，但俄军却为所欲为地轰炸，毁坏了我们的一切！
 
The people of Ukraine just want to live a peaceful, uncontested life, building our homes in peace, but the Russian army is bombing and destroying everything we have at their whim!
 
布查70%的城市被摧毁，马尔科夫卡50%的城市变成废墟。
 
70% of the Bucha city was destroyed and 50% of Markivka city was turned into ruins.
 
俄军占领了这些城市，残忍地屠杀无辜平民，有些俄军士兵甚至当着乌克兰父母的面强奸小男孩和小女孩，毫无人性、丧尽天良！
 
Russian troops occupied these cities and brutally slaughtered innocent civilians, some Russian soldiers even raped young children in front of the  parents of Ukrainian children in an inhumane and conscienceless manner!
 
例数着俄军令人发指的爆行，她愤恨不已潸然泪下，并对媒体报道的高达80%支持普京侵略乌克兰的俄罗斯人表示深恶痛绝。
 
She wept with indignation as she counted the heinous atrocities of Russian troops and expressed her deep disgust at media reports that up to 80% of Russians supported Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
 
当妮可问她是否对战争感到恐惧时，她表示在战争初期是的，几乎所有乌克兰人都感到恐惧。
 
When Nicole asked her whether she was scared of the war, she said that in the early days it was and as well as almost all Ukrainians.
 
当战争持续一两周后大家的恐惧就变成了愤怒，越来越多的乌克兰人拿起枪去了前线。
 
As the war continued for a week or two, everyone’s fear turned to anger, more and more Ukrainians took up their guns and went to the front.
 
当时自己也想去前线为保卫国家、为亲人和同胞尽一份力量，但考虑到自己连枪支怎么使用都不知道，去了只会给别人添麻烦，
 
At that time, she also wanted to go to the front line for the defense of the country, for her relatives and compatriots, but considering that she did not even know how to use a gun, it would only cause trouble for others,
 
所以最后决定来到梅迪卡难民营做义工，在后方救助难民同胞，让前线的乌克兰军人无后顾之忧。
 
finally, she decided to volunteer in the refugee camp in Medyca to help her compatriots in the rear, so that the Ukrainian soldiers on the front line would not be worried.
 
她希望身处险境的乌军在世界正义力量的帮助下变得越来越强大，希望他们英勇杀敌，将俄军早日赶出乌克兰，尽快结束这场战争。
 
She hoped that the Ukrainian army in danger would become stronger and stronger with the assistance of the justice forces in the world, and that they would kill the enemy bravely to drive the Russian army out of Ukraine and end this war as soon as possible.
 
妮可表示全世界所有心地善良的人都会与乌克兰人民站在一起。
 
Nicole stated that all kind-hearted people around the world would stand with Ukrainian people.
 
我们是来自新中国联邦的中国人，我们来到这里就是要和你们乌克兰人民坚定地站在一起！
 
We are Chinese from the NFSC and we have come here to stand firmly with you, the Ukrainian people!

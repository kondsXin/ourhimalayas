近日，有浙江用户收到中国移动的官方短信：
 
Recently, some customers in Zhejiang received an official SMS from China Mobile:
 
为防范境外电话诈骗，保护客户财产安全，根据上级主管部门要求，浙江移动将默认关闭接听国际及港澳台电话的功能；
 
To prevent overseas phone fraud and protect customers’ property, according to the requirements of higher authorities, Zhejiang Mobile will close the function of receiving international, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan calls by default.
 
若仍需接听国际及港澳台电话，请在5月20日前发送 1219 至 10086 进行确认登记。
 
If you still need to receive international, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan calls, please send 1219 to 10086 before May 20 to confirm registration.
 
中国移动浙江负责人默认了此事属实，且正通过短信分批通知客户。
 
The person in charge of China Mobile Zhejiang acquiesced that this is true and is notifying customers in batches via SMS.
 
河南移动、河南联通、河南电信也早已发布公告，自5月7日起已将国际及港澳台短信接收功能默认为关闭状态。
 
Henan Mobile, Henan Unicom, and Henan Telecom have also issued announcements that the international, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan SMS receiving function has been turned off by default since May 7.
 
5月10日，中共移民管理局开会并发文要求从严从紧执行出入境政策，
 
On May 10, the Communist Party of China Immigration Bureau issued an announcement, calling for strict and tight enforcement of entry and exit policies,
 
限制老百姓非必要出境活动，严格出入境证件审批和签发，
 
It will strictly enforce non-essential exit activities of the people, strictly approof and issue entry and exit documents,
 
严密边境口岸管控；严打非法出入境活动，切断边境地区非法出入境主要通道；
 
tightly control of border crossings, strictly crackdown on illegal entry and exit activities, cut off the main channels for illegal entry and exit in border areas,
 
认真履行移民管理职责与任务，深化移民管理领域 “放管服” 改革，严格落实新时代移民管理机构 “八条铁规” 。
 
seriously perform the immigration management duties and tasks, deepen the field of immigration management’s ” reforms to streamline the government, delegate power, and improve government services, ” strictly implement the “eight iron rules” of immigration management agencies in the new era.
 
加上早期体制内收缴出国护照，以及最近各大口岸陆续报道有人的护照入境即被剪掉，
 
Together with the earlier news of people’s passports were confiscated to leave the country, cut off upon entry at major ports of entry,
 
甚至护照在登机口就被无任何理由当场撕烂不准出国的举动，
 
torn up at the boarding gate without any reasons,
 
意味着老百姓肉身出境的大门正在关闭。
 
this series of moves to prevent people from leaving the country means that the door is closing for people who want to leave the country physically.
 
众所周知，国际社交媒体和金融机构的注册都需要手机号来接收短信验证码的，
 
As we all know, the registration of international social media and financial institutions require cell phone numbers to receive SMS verification codes,
 
随着中国移动的对外屏蔽，通讯和金融出境的通道也将被逐步切断。
 
and with China Mobile’s external blocking, communication and financial activities will be gradually cut off from outside.
 
中共从最初建网络防火墙实现媒体垄断，
 
The Communist Party’s initial monopoly on media by establishing firewalls,
 
到以防疫为名实施“动态清零“、严酷封锁、非人道隔离的社会网格化管理，
 
the “dynamic zeroing Covid”, severe blockading, and inhumane segregating of social grid management in the name of epidemic prevention,
 
进而出台从严从紧的出入境政策，并加强对外通信管控，
 
then enforcing a strict and tight immigration policy, and now controlling the foreign communications,
 
一切都在朝着闭关锁国的方向推进。
 
are all moving in the direction of seclusion.
 
温水煮青蛙，老百姓在不知不觉中已变成了“畜奴”被牢牢地圈禁起来。
 
In the process of “boiling frogs in warm water,” the people have unknowingly become “animal slaves” and are firmly imprisoned.

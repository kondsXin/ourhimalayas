` MOSVIDEO` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/2498900/)

4月30日晚些时候，仅次于副总统的第二顺位美国总统候选人、众议院议长佩洛西率国会高层代表团秘访基辅，
 
Later on April 30, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the second-in-line US presidential candidate only to the Vice President, led a high-level congressional delegation on a secret visit to Kyiv,
 
随行的众议员有众议院情报委员会主席希夫，众议院外交事务委员会主席米克斯，众议院规则委员会主席麦戈文，来自加州的众议员芭芭拉，来自马萨诸塞州的众议员基廷，来自科罗拉多州的众议员克罗。
 
accompanying members of the House were House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Meeks, House Rules Committee Chairman McGovern, Congresswoman Barbara from California, Congressman Keating from Massachusetts, and Congressman Crowe from Colorado.
 
代表团与乌克兰总统泽连斯基及其高级助手会谈了三个小时，获得了启动一个巨大的一揽子援乌计划的第一手资料。
 
The delegation met for three hours with Ukrainian President Zelensky and his senior aides and obtained first-hand information on the launch of a huge package of aid for Ukraine.
 
此举旨在向普京发出一个强烈的信号，即美国将坚定地与乌克兰人民站在一起，对乌克兰的武器与其他形式的援助是不会停止的。
 
The move was intended to send a strong signal to Putin that the United States would firmly stand with the Ukrainian people and that arms and other forms of assistance to Ukraine would not stop.
 
代表团基辅之行的信息是在他们安全离开乌克兰后才公布的。
 
Information about the delegation’s trip to Kyiv was only published after they had safely left Ukraine.
 
佩洛西是自俄罗斯侵略乌克兰战争爆发以来访问乌克兰级别最高的美国官员。
 
Pelosi is the highest ranking US official to visit Ukraine since the outbreak of Russian aggression against Ukraine.
 
她在其办公室发布的会议视频中赞扬了乌克兰及其领导人反抗俄军侵略的意志和决心。
 
In a video of the meeting released by her office, she praised Ukraine and its leaders for their will and determination defense against Russia’s invasion.
 
并告诉泽连斯基“我们的承诺是在战斗结束之前一直在你们身边。你们的战斗是为每个人而战，感谢你们为自由而战！”
 
and she told Zelensky “We believe that we are visiting your to say thank you for your fight for freedom. That we’re on a frontier for freedom and that your fight is a fight for everyone and so our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done!”
 
在密访基辅离开乌克兰后，5月1日佩洛西在波兰自豪地告诉记者“代表团向泽伦斯基传达了美国国会团结一致的信息，美国人民对他的领导力表示赞赏，对乌克兰人民的勇气表示钦佩！”
 
After leaving Ukraine on her secret visit to Kyiv, Pelosi proudly told reporters in Poland on May 1 that “the delegation delivered a message of unity to the U.S. Congress to Zelensky, and the American people appreciate his leadership and admire the courage of the Ukrainian people!”
 
美国国会代表团成员一致称赞乌克兰对俄军侵略的誓死抵抗，并将这场战争描绘为正义与邪恶的斗争，承诺美国将继续对乌克兰提供长期的军事、经济和人道主义支持。
 
Members of the US Congressional delegation unanimously praised Ukraine’s pledge of resistance to Russian aggression and portrayed the war as a struggle between good and evil, pledging continued long-term US military, economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine.
 
克罗则强调乌克兰之行有三个重点领域，那就是“武器、武器、还是武器！”，并说：“我们必须确保乌克兰人拥有获胜所需的东西，
 
Krogh, for his part, stressed three key focus areas for his trip to Ukraine, namely “arms, arms, or arms!” and said, “We must ensure that the Ukrainians have what they need to win,
 
过去两个月里看到了他们的意志、战斗力、强烈的自豪感，以及如他们得到支持而获胜的能力。
 
the last two months have seen the will, the fight, the strong sense of pride and the ability to win if they are supported.
 
我们将与乌克兰站在一起，直到胜利”。
 
We will stand with Ukraine until victory”.
 
米克斯说：“现在是我们支持民主的时候了，否则我们就纵容了专制”。
 
“It is time for us to support democracy, or we condone tyranny”, said Meeks.
 
希夫也表达了自己对战争局势的特别关注，确保乌克兰及时获得美国的情报支持以击败俄军。
 
Schiff also expressed his particular concern about the war situation and ensuring that Ukraine received timely intelligence support from the US to defeat the Russian forces.
 
麦戈文最后指出“普京残酷的侵略战争不再只是针对乌克兰人民的战争，也是一场针对世界上弱势群体的战争！”
 
McGovern concluded that “Putin’s brutal war of aggression is no longer just a war against the Ukrainian people, it is also a war against the world’s vulnerable!”

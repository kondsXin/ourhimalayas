## 视频|Bright Jar创始人将深入了解中共的邪恶本质
` MOSVIDEO` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/2593299/)

2022年5月3日，妮可战友在梅迪卡大帐篷采访英国人道救援组织Bright Jar创始人Jan, 该组织在这为乌克兰难民筹款并照顾他们。Jan毫不掩饰地称赞新中国联邦咖啡是他喝到的全城最好的咖啡。妮可向他介绍我们是由寻求自由和正义的中国人成立的法治基金赞助的新中国联邦救援团队，团队成员来自世界不同的国家，都是从独裁统治下的中共国幸运逃离出来的中国人。我们3月初搭建的这个大帐篷已接待了超过1万名难民，我们的使命是消灭中国共产党。中共是普京的朋友，中共不代表中国人，就像普京不代表俄罗斯人一样，在这里也有不少俄罗斯人正在帮助乌克兰难民，这就是人性的光辉。
 
On May 3rd, 2022, fellow fighter Nicole interviewed Jan, founder of Bright Jar, a British humanitarian relief organization here to raise money and care for Ukrainian refugees, at the big tent in Medyka. Jan fervently praised the NFSC coffee as the best he had ever had in town. Nicole introduced him to us as the New Federal State of China(NFSC) rescue team sponsored by the Rule of Law Foundation, founded by Chinese seeking freedom and justice, with team members from different countries around the world, who are all Chinese who had been lucky enough to escape from the dictatorial Communist country of China. We have hosted over 10,000 refugees in this large tent we set up in early March with the mission of eliminating the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP is a friend of Vladimir Putin. The CCP does not represent the Chinese, just as Putin does not represent the Russians, and there are many Russians here who are helping the Ukrainian refugees, which is the light of humanity.
 
Jan称中国人的反抗与乌克兰人有很多相似之处，我们都是为了支持乌克兰人捍卫自由而来到这里，虽然我迄今并不了解中共国的实际情况，但在这里我们就像是一个大家庭，坚定地站在一起，并建立了友谊，通过你们可以深入地了解有关中国发生的事情。妮可表示我们来到这里不仅是为了帮助逃离战争迫害的乌克兰人，也是为了帮助那些依旧生活在中共极权压迫下的14亿中国同胞。实际上我们所有人都生活在邪恶中共对人类的威胁和迫害之中，当下疫情就是中共在实验室制造的生物武器在全世界故意传播导致的一场针对全球的超限战，人们因此必须戴口罩、被迫接种毒疫苗，而这些销往全球的口罩正是由中共国集中营内的奴隶劳工生产的廉价产品。
 
Jan says there are many similarities between the Chinese resistance and the Ukrainian resistance, and we all came here to support the Ukrainians in their defense of freedom. He also says, “Although I don’t know the reality of the communist China so far, we are here as one big family, standing firmly together and building friendships, and through you we can gain insight into what is happening in China.” Nicole says we are here not only to help Ukrainians flee war persecution, but also to help our 1.4 billion Chinese citizens who still live under the totalitarian oppression of the Chinese Communist Party. Virtually all of us are living in the midst of the evil Chinese Communist threat and persecution of humanity. The current epidemic is an unrestricted warfare against the world caused by the deliberate worldwide spread of a biological weapon created by the Chinese Communist Party in its laboratories, resulting in a global war of supremacy that is forcing people to wear masks and take vaccines.  The masks are cheaply produced by slave labor in the Communist Party’s concentration camps.
 
妮可表示他们不了解中共是因当今世界主流媒体几乎都被中共控制了，他们不但不提供真相，反而在掩盖真相和歪曲事实。Jan认为都是因全球化多年的世界机制出了问题，世界已习惯依赖俄罗斯的天然气等能源和中共国廉价商品的供应，我们必须改变这些情况才能改变世界。
 
Nicole says they don’t understand the CCP because the world’s mainstream media is almost entirely controlled by them, and instead of providing the truth, they cover up the truth and distort the facts.

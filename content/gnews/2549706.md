2022年4月27日，俄罗斯副总理兼总统驻远东联邦区全权代表特鲁特涅夫、远东和北极发展部部长切昆科夫出席了在下列宁斯科耶市举行的中俄首座跨境铁路大桥的竣工开通典礼。该桥是将俄方犹太自治州下列宁斯科耶市与中方黑龙江省同江市连通起来的界河铁路大桥。切昆科夫在典礼上表示该桥竣工将为本地区经济发展带来变化，为俄中扩大合作注入新动力。
 
On April 27th, 2022, Deputy Prime Minister and Plenipotentiary of the President of Russia in the Far Eastern Federal District Vladimir Trutnev and Minister of Far Eastern and Arctic Development Vladimir Cherkunkov attended the completion and opening ceremony of the first Russian-Chinese cross-border railroad bridge in the city of Nizhniy Leninskoye. The bridge is a railroad bridge over the river that connects the Russian city of Nizhny Leninskoye in the Jewish Autonomous Region with the Chinese city of Tongjiang in Heilongjiang Province. Speaking at the ceremony, Cherkunkov said that the completion of the bridge would bring changes to the economic development of the region and give new impetus to the expansion of Russian-Chinese cooperation.
 
同江-下列宁斯科耶铁路桥主桥长约2.2公里，中方境内段长1886米，俄方境内段长309米，设计运营时速100公里，年过货能力2100万吨。该桥工程于2008年3月正式立项，2014年2月26日开工奠基，2018年10月中方段施工完成，按计划2021年8月中方段与俄方段实现铺轨贯通。但由于俄方拖延，始终没有落实俄方段铁路的铺设，导致铁路桥无法按时竣工开通。俄乌战争爆发后，俄方为了承接来自中共国的大量武器和物资援助，便开始加速落实该桥的铁路工程，仅在短短两个月内就完成了俄方十多年来都不愿完成的这条铁路贯通。
 
Tongjiang – Nizhny Leninskoye railroad main bridge is about 2.2 kilometers long, the Chinese section is 1886 meters long, the Russian section is 309 meters long.  It is designed to operate at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour, the annual cargo capacity of 21 million tons. The bridge project was formally established in March 2008 and the foundation stone was laid on February 26th, 2014. The construction of the Chinese section was completed in October 2018. According to the plan, the Chinese section and the Russian section was supposed to achieve the connection in August 2021. However, due to the Russian’s delay, the laying of the Russian section of the railroad has never been implemented, resulting in the railroad bridge not being completed and opened on time. After the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian war, the Russian began to accelerate the implementation of the bridge’s railroad project in order to receive a large amount of arms and material assistance from the Chinese Communist Party. In just two months, the Russian completed the railroad connection, which the Russian had been reluctant to complete for more than a decade.
 
俄罗斯侵略乌克兰的战争自2022年2月24日开始后，中共通过经由绥芬河口岸的中欧班列给俄罗斯源源不断地提供了大量的战略物资支持。同江铁路桥的开通不但新增了一条对俄罗斯的铁路运输通道，而且将黑龙江经由同江口岸到莫斯科的铁路运输距离较经由绥芬河口岸到莫斯科缩短了809公里，节省了近10小时的运输时间，为中共明目张胆地支持俄罗斯侵略乌克兰提供了更为方便快捷的运输条件。
 
Since the beginning of Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, 2022, the Chinese Communist Party has been providing Russia with a large amount of military supplies through the China-European train via the Suifen River port. The opening of the Tongjiang railroad bridge not only added a new railroad transport route to Russia, but also shortened the distance from Heilongjiang to Moscow via Tongjiang port by 809 kilometers compared to Suifenhe port, saving nearly 10 hours of transport time and providing a more convenient and faster transportation condition for the Chinese Communist Party to blatantly support Russia’s invasion against Ukraine.

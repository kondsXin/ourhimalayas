On September 14, the RFI citing the Times report that the Cambridge Center for China Management Studies (CCCM), which is part of Cambridge University’s Judge Business School, has apparently been infiltrated by Huawei.  Three quarters of the center’s directors are linked to Huawei. Its chief representative, Hu Yanping, is a former Huawei vice president and a continuing recipient of a “special allowance” from the Chinese State Council.

Huawei is an intelligence agency of the Chinese Communist Party’s military. The Chinese government also requires information and communication companies to share user information with the government. Due to national security concerns, Huawei has been excluded from fifth-generation mobile communications (5G) construction in many countries, including the UK. The University of Cambridge’s close relationship with Huawei is therefore a threat to the UK’s national security. This has drawn the attention of Smith, the former leader of the British Conservative Party, Tugenhardt, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament, the leader of the Conservative Party’s China Study Group, and Patterson, the policy director of the British non-governmental organization Hong Kong Monitor. They called on the government and the university to launch an investigation.

There have been numerous scandals over the years about the Chinese Communist Party actively infiltrating major prestigious institutions with funding and programs. The Times revealed last year that the University of Cambridge’s China Management Research Center had received donations of £200,000 and £155,000 from the Chinese government and Huawei last year. Twenty of the UK’s top universities were revealed a few months ago to have received more than £40 million in recent years from Huawei and other Chinese government-held companies. Oxford University said to the public in 2018 that it would no longer accept Huawei’s funding.

There has been an international backlash against various Chinese Communist Party perversions. The repeated revelations of infiltration of prestigious British universities by Chinese companies, such as Huawei, also reflect a shift in the political winds in British politics.

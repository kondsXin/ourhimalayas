请，现在请连线接进来吧。（对纳瓦罗说）You look at this the follower, every VPN, behind maybe 1.2 million, 1.4 million.

**Mr. Bannon****：**Is it that big? Yeah.

**Miles Guo****: **The VPN, but look at this, this is the big big number, big day. OK, this from… 介绍一下，请各位介绍一下自己，Rachel，Nana，来介绍一下自己啊。

**Nana: **Hi, Mr.. Bannon, Mr.. Navaro, and Mr.. Miller, I’m Nana, so happy to see you guys here.

**Bannon**: Hi.

**Nana****:** It’s good to see you.

**Miles Guo**: Thank you.

**Racheal****: **Hello, this is Rachel. It’s a great honour to be here with you on the live-stream.  You guys are my hero, so I’m looking forward to this conversation.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.

**Mr. Bannon****: **Thank you.  Thank you for joining us.

**Eric:** Hi, Mr.. Bannon, Mr.. Navarro, Mr.. Miller, and also Miles Guo. I’m very honoured to be in the streaming.  After this episode, I will immediately call my Mom to thank her for her for giving me the right time of my birth, so that today I can sit here together with you all.  Thank you very much.  You are the hereof all Chinese.

**Bannon**: Thank you.  Thank your mother.

**Miles Guo****:** 谁先问？请问吧，有问题。

**Nana:** So, OK, Mr.. Bannon, I have one question for you. With the side effect of the vaccine are slowly showing up everywhere, and it’s affecting all kinds of aspects in people’s lives, what do you think the post-COVID-vaccine world would be like?

**Mr. Bannon****: **well, I think it’s gonna…since the CCP put the virus out through Wuhan to the entire world as Miles told us, you know, almost 2 years ago, you know, in January of 2020, I think that the world has been searching for solution.  And they haven’t looked at the solution and get to the bottom of the Wuhan Lab, and so I don’t even think we can conceive of what a post-COVID world is right now. Because as you see it, it’s expanding everywhere,  in France and Germany, they are locking down in England more than opening up, and in United States.  It’s all over the map.  We need to have a comprehensive strategy, even before start talking about vaccines, this messenger RNA. And the central thing that the world has to do is what we’ve been preaching from day one, what Miles’ been preaching, we have to get to the bottom of what happened in Wuhan Lab.  And the Chinese Communist Party has to open up, and allow the world’s scientists to get into the Wuhan Lab, see what the Biological Weapon Program was like.  It’s the only thing before we come to some decisions.  As long as this CCP continues to hold back what’s within that Lab, the biggest victims are the Chinese people, the Chinese nation, and the rest of mankind. So, I still think we should still focus on getting to the bottom of the Wuhan Lab.

**Nana****: **Thank you.

**Mr. Navaro****:** Yeah, I would reiterate that, if I may, that this is the CCP virus and it came from the Wuhan Lab.  The Wuhan Lab is a Bioweapons Lab.  And regrettably, Dr. Anthony Fauci here in the United States played a key role, funding that research, and he needs to be held accountable along with the CCP.

To get to a post-COVID world, I think that, I don’t think we get quite there .  The way to get there is through hoard immunity, and the big thing missing now in the equation is therapeutics, treating the virus.  Older people,  people with bidity should get the vaccine,  but everyone else who is not at big risk with the vaccine needs to simply be able to get hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, zinc and whole wide range of therapeutic, and the antibody you get from have the virus is 20 times stronger than that of from the vaccine.  We can get to the world where the human spices adapts through the use of the strong therapeutics, but unfortunately, Dr. Fauci and the Biden regime, the illegitimate Biden regime, are preventing the use of these therapeutics, and killing people.

**Mr. Bannon****:  **One last thing, and I want to add this, I think Dr. Tony Fauci and NIH and Washington DC, not simply owe an explanation to the American people, I think even more, they owe explanations to Laobaixing and to Chinese people of exactly what they financed with the PLA, and with the CCP, in Wuhan behind everybody’s back.  And I think Fauci needs to go to Wuhan, and I think he needs to address the people of China, and to explain exactly what he did, and beg for forgiveness of the Chinese people.

**Mr. Navaro****: ** He needs to prostrate himself on his knees and beg for forgiveness.

**Mr. Bannon****:** 100%.

**Mr. Navaro****: **Next question?

**Nana****: **Thank you.

**Racheal****: **Yes, thank you.  Eric, you go ahead, we have a… we take turn.

**Eric:** OK, it’s my turn. This question, if I may, is for Mr.. Navarro.  I have to say, I’m one of the interpreters of G-Translators.  We have been interpreting War Room for over one year. And I have a coworker, colleague, who is a very beautiful lady, and she is a greatest fan of Mr.. Navarro.  So, when you appear every time in War Room, she just shouts: Oh, here comes Peter Navarro!

**Mr. Miller:  **Is she also blind? （roared with laughter）

**Mr. Bannon****: **Oh, oh, ahaha…

**Eric:** So, here comes my question, we have been to Miles Guo with a lot of detailed stuffs, analysis and exposure, that the CCP regime is having all kinds of trouble, financial sanction, and also the real estate nothing else. So we have been known through all these years of all kinds of crises accumulation in CCP regime, it’s becoming definitely broke down.  But recently with president Xi, crack down on the Big-Techs, and those overseas listed companies, the situation must have been exacerbated.  So, how do you take the total collapse of the CCP regime’s economy?  Thank you.

**Mr. Navaro****: **You make a very important point. Like right now, the Chinese real estate markets the bubble of all bubbles.  And it threatens the collapse of the Chinese economy.  The thing we have to do here in the United States is stop, stop the flow of American capital to China through our pension funds.  This is something I tried to do in the White House.  But sitting here in New York city, few miles from Wall Street, there’s Americans like Steve Schwarzman, Larry Fink, John Thornton, and others, Ray Dalio, who buries themselves on TV.  These are the people who are pressuring Washington DC to keep that flow of money from our pension funds, to prop up the CCP.  We need to take down the CCP, in order to take down the CCP, we need to stop the flow of American capital to fuel these bubbles and transnational criminal organization, which is buying real estate here with the deplorable, the American and Laobaixing in China.  It has to stop.

**Mr. Bannon****: ** I just want to add to that, and this is equivalent of what Fauci needs to apologize to the Chinese people.  The Wall Street tycoons, and I address this to every Laobaixing, and every citizens of China, that’s getting wiped out now of their savings in these fraudulent real estate companies.  Those companies are propped up not just by the CCP, they’re propped up by Wall Street.  And every penny that Dalio and Schwarzman and Fink and these guys have used  American pension money to put in the back of these phony real estate companies and sucked in.  The real victims here are the Chinese people.  The hard-working Chinese people make almost no money, and save all their money and put in these companies.  They’ve been wiped out, they’ve been financially destroyed, and part of the financial destruction is the elites of the Untied States have supported the criminal organization and to take as much money as possible.  I think they have a fiduciary responsibility to pay back every penny they’ve taken out of any of these companies, and to give that in some sort of restitution to the Chinese investors, to the little guys China. The Laobaixing, and the little guys in China have been wiped out and that is unacceptable.  That is not what capitalism is about.  That is crony capitalism, it’s basically theft.

And until we hold the elites here in America that have forced this onto Chinese people, we are not making any progress.

**Eric:  **Thank you very much.  And all the Kleptocrats in the CCP regime just listened Mr.. Bannon delivered (his) conviction.  Thank you.  Back to you Nana

**Nana****: **Rachel.

**Racheal****: ** I think it’s my return.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you for Mr.. Bannon always speak for the Chinese people who cannot speak, who are silenced.  But my question this time is for Mr.. Jason Miller.  First of all, thank you so much for everything you’ve done, and your team have done for GETTR.  We witnessed a miracle, and fantastic growth in the first couple, several months, so thank you so much.

so, I wanna ask you about, first of all, I want to get a sense of what you see the advantages and opportunities that GETTR has in comparison to Twitter? How do we compete with Twitter?

**Mr. Miller:  **Absolutely!  Thank you Rachel for the opportune to speak with youth so many others right now. I just put down a couple things, at the big level the advantage we have, is something that Twitter will never be able to duplicate, and that’s excitement.  And the most powerful force in the world is an idea, once you create an idea within people, would you give them the ability to self-expression and freedom of speech, that takes hold and you can’t remove that.  There is no excitement with Twitter, quite frankly in a social media platform, such as Facebook or anything else.

So, we believe that our value proposition, our belief in free speech, but also oppose to cancel culture, that  is uniting people all over the world. So for as much as the globalist elite sin the media would try to say that the populist in their respective countries is some kind of a bad idea, the people in the US shouldn’t be pro-US, or the people in Brazil shouldn’t be pro-Brazil.

I’ve actually interacted with people on social media, interacted with people from different countries, via social media on GETTR in the past two months   more than what happened in 12 years, for example.  Very excited to announce we have a translation feature, that will be coming very soon.  Probably within the next… say within the next 3, 4 days, which means next week or two.  (Mr. Bannon laughed)

Joe Wang are glorious Chief Technology Officer here.  Joe is my friend. But the engineers all over the world are working so hard on this, and we’re really appreciative for their work.  Part of the reason why I’m excite about this is because then it goes much more beyond let’s say interacting with people from Europe or Brazil, but also interacting with the free people of China, who want to live without fear of persecution, and be able to have self-expression.

when we talk about technical details, what’s different between GETTR and let’s say Twitter, Facebook, longer post up to 777 characters, longer videos up to 3 minutes, for news creators and influencers upload of 10 minute videos that we can allow for. Some really cool additional features that will be coming addition of live-streaming which will be coming next month. So we’re excited about the growth and development on that.  And I think it will outweigh the Twitter hasn’t had, sharper pictures, sharper images.  But again, go back to the fact that you will never be de-platformed or censored for your political opinions on GETTR.

And this is something that people can, regardless of what country you are from, regardless of what the free-speech right that the government might tell you that you have, on GETTR you will always be able to express yourself freely and openly.

**Mr. Navaro****:** Hey, let me say this, GETTR is the Twitter-killer. (clap) This is what we have to do, GETTR is the Twitter-killer, and why do we have to kill Twitter? This is the easy sell here, Twitter wants to silence you.  If you think or let me… Look the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Ze-Dong going back to the communist threat, you have like bad thoughts, they define what the bad thoughts are, no, no, no.  Free speech here in America, Twitter took that away from you  American people, from international users.  GETTR is the Twitter-killer full stop.  Free speech, that’s what it’s all about.  (clap)

Racheal:  Thank you so much for both of your answers.  The way I understand it, I think I’m tired of the old world, Twitter is everything about it, they label you, and they give you racism, you’re agism, but there are borders.  You’re from Brazil, you are from China, but in the GETTR world, we’re united.  First time, I felt like there’s no border.  I can really be a free…, I’ll be free and not fear of consequences. So, I think that’s the excitement about GETTR.  It’s all about the future.

I have another question for you, Mr.. Miller, it’s all about GETTR as well.  So, I’ll let you to share about what some of the things you heard from the users about their user experience?I’m sure you’re closely monitoring those information. If you can share with us, what you have received.

**Mr. Miller: **Absolutely.  I usually spend probably about an hour every evening just going through comments that I personally receive.  I think that’s important for CEOs, someone who’s leading a team and a platform, be very doubted and connected to the users, so I take great pride in that. I think ever since we had, we’ve added our notifications feature, then I think the interaction with comments and responses come together quite a bit.  Some of the things I would expect people ask you for additional features come out, that I would have thought of some, I did not know the dark mode for example.  There’re fans around the world love dark mode, they’re violently attached to their dark mode, and they get mad that we didn’t have dark mode, we have it now. Just share ruins clear, but it’s a… Look, we do listen to the users platform, we take the feedback, we take it serious.

And I think there’s also the sense of truth-telling. I think at GETTR the people are expressing, you know what we can’t tell the truth on Twitter, we can’t tell the truth on Facebook, or we can’t tell the truth in this country, there’ll be people coming after us.  So, that’s something I’ve heard quite a bit.  The people said that, it’s so great that people from around the world are expressing similar ideals.

**Mr. Bannon****: **Look I think you can see the manifestation of what Jason saying comes from engagement.  We look at the engagement on GETTR versus engagements anywhere else.  I know so many people come over to this platform and the first thing they’re blown away is by how the GETTR community globally is so engaged.  They get more reposts, they get more comments, so I think that the proof is in the pudding, and the pudding is engagement.  people are very engagement, once they made the move to come to GETTR, they see a whole barge of community around the world, talking to each other.  I also think that you don’t see the snarky hate as much, and I think it’s very positive, it’s very intends to be what it should be.  and I think that’s what take GETTR to another level.  You see that engagement.

**Mr. Miller:** And I just had one point that I’ve started sharing in a number of interviews saying that ,  when I get up in the morning, I actually look forward opening up GETTR and see what people are talking about what’s news, and what’s happening. Or I wake up with Twitter, ah, it’s negative, it’s depressing, everything is just people who don’t like their lives, want you to be miserable also.   GETTR, there is a lot of excitement, and wonderful things. To paraphrase my old boss, and all of our old bosses, saying, we wanna make social media fun again.

We can convince the people to come and visit the platform once, but if we don’t make it fun, if we don’t keep it fun, they’re not gonna keep coming back. And that continued user base is critical.  Miles, I have a broadcast at exact the same time at the other studio, so thank you very much to everybody, it’s been an honour to be with you.  I do have this broadcast, so I gotta run.

**Miles Guo****: ** Thank you, thank you.

**Mr. Bannon****:** you notice that ever since he became CEO, he’s like he can’t be bought off for very long.

But I do want to add one thing that Jason’s saying at, I think this is so powerful about GETTR is that, the toxicity.  Hey look, look, Jason Miller is a very tough guy, Miles Guo is a very tough guy.  （手扶Navarro）This guy is the toughest guy.  I’m pretty tough too. we can take a lot of hate and stuff like that.  but there’s a difference between people attacking and toxicity.  The power of GETTR I think is it provides a platform that people know that they are not gonna be cancelled on, but they are playing to their better angels, they’re positive, they’re putting information out, they got a platform that they know they’ve built their own community in that platform, that they  own their user base, they are not gonna be thrown out.  And I think that’s taking GETTR to the next level.  I think the key to GETTR is just to get more people  on and this community is building, and it’s building in a positive way.

You’re seeing that through the engagement, I know Peter he’s comes on.  Peter’s got a whole list of things he’s gonna do with Jason.

So, remember, GETTR’s only about a hundred days old, under a hundred days old.  you compare the first hundred days of GETTR and the first hundred days of Twitter, there’s no comparison.  This thing is so much more powerful, and I think that it’s the positive nature of it, the empowerment of it, you see through the engagement.  I think that sky is the limit for GETTR.

**Racheal****: **Thank you. And I’ll give it back to NANA

**Nana:** Thank you Rachel.  So, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Navarro, I have one question for both of you.  Seeing Xi JinPing has been so aggressive with his decisions and actions, it could really take an opposite toll on Chinese economy , and seeing Miles working hard, like us too the fellow fighters, when do you think that the New Federal State of China will actually take down the CCP?  And when will the US government recognize the New Federal State of China? Thank you.

**Mr. Navaro****: ** I think it’s already taking down the CCP, you can see the erosion in the financial portion of Chinese economy, and I think the way the authoritarian move of the dictator Xi Jin Ping, now consolidate power is an act of desperation, as Miles Guo leads this new nation offshore of China, and whiten China more and more Laobaixing become totally upset. This whole latest episode, with, is it Evergrande? You see people absolutely incendiary angry about what’s going on, and that frightens Xi Jin Ping.  I don’t think you will see that kind of authoritarianism unless he was fearful.

So, what we need to do here in America, Steve’s role, my role, Pompeo’s role, and others’, is to  put the pressure on.  It’s unfortunate that the election was stolen from Donald Trump, we’re working on getting that back.  But in the meantime, you have the illegitimate Biden regime in bed with Xi Jin Ping.  It’s not helpful, so we got to keep the pressure on, and that’s what we gonna do here.

**Mr. Bannon****: ** I wanna step back and just mentioning one thing about the official recognition of the New Federal State versus the take down of the CCP.  What the New Federal State, the Whistleblower Movement, the Rule of Law Society and Foundation, the GETTR, G-Fashion, G-Coin, all these.  What the world is seeing is a new China, and the new Chinese.  And they are seeing what the Chinese can accomplish when they have the freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of press, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly.  And I think that’s come about a lot through the New Federal State of China than these other groups.  That is so powerful.  Our focus now, and I do believe the New Federal State if the CCP last long enough would be recognized, I think it will be recognized in after 2024.  But our focus 100% is to present the New China and the new Chinese every day.

The only the CCP’s taken down is by the Chinese people.  People in the West can assist, we can help, but the Chinese people, the Laobaixing, have to take it down.  We’re at a unique time in Chinese history of what, 10, 15 thousand years?You finally have the diaspora of the Chinese people.  Hundreds of millions that have been enormously successful.  and that shows every day the lie of this regime.  The lie of the regime is the Chinese people on Mainland China, the only people on earth that comes from one of the most ancient and respect civilizations that do not have even a modest amount of freedom. And that is our mission.  I think our mission have to focus on taking down this transnational criminal organization that is terrorize, victimize, and brutalize the Chinese nation and the Chinese people.  We do that, if we do that, the New Federal State would almost act like a government in exile to present, going forward what’s the new progress.  What’s why listen, I have the greatest respect for Miles, but I was gonna say, I think Miles is the George Washington of the New China.

We are talking about a New China and a new Chinese.  Chinese have finally had freedom, after millennia of history, they finally freedom on the outside in the West, and you see how they prosper, you see how they contribute to the society, you see how their family structure, the traditional value of the Chinese are very powerful, and that is why it is so important for us to remain focused on our mission and our mission is to take down the CCP, take down the transnational criminal organization.

**Mr. Navaro****: **Steve is absolutely right, ultimately, it has to come from within China to take down the CCP. But as we know, one of our famous expressions in China, one spark can create a prairie fire.  We need that prairie fire, it has to be within China, but this gentleman here is creating a few sparks, and we will keep creating sparks, and help bring that prairie fire along.

**Mr. Bannon****: **Our responsibility, Peter and I are taking it very seriously, and other people   associated with the Trump Movement, we have a tremendous responsibility to the Chinese people, and that is to stop Western elites in those partnerships with the transnational criminal organization that are making money out of victimization and brutalization of the Chinese people, and to hold them accountable, even to the point of reparation back to the Chinese people for the money they’ve stolen at China that is rightly  the earning and the wealth of the Chinese people.  This is all gonna come… and we have the responsibility to hammer the elites everyday, whether Steve Schwarzian or Dalio or Fink or all these essential criminal class that has been in partnership, in business with the criminal organization of the Chinese Communist Party.  So, That’s our responsibility, and to assist the New Federal State and others.

But our focus should be the complete destruction of the Chinese Communist Party, and our support for the New China and the new Chinese.

**Miles Guo****: **Thank you sir very much. Thank you sir.  I’m not China’s George Washington.  I just want to take down the CCP, disappear and go to the mountain.  I want hundred girlfriend and enjoy my life.  You look all these girls are beautiful.  This is new Chinese girl. But they all have husband, that’s the problem.  All married.  So, I’m the true-color man, I’m not the CCP lair: Oh I’m loyal to my wife, I’m loyal to my family, but they are behind the camera, all the camera, they have motel girlfriends, they drink, they steal money, they tell lies, everything’s lie, everything is fake.

All the economy, I talked to you in the lunch, China’s real estate total valuation is 90 trillion, 95 trillion, officially, this is 55 trillion, over China GDP 4 times.  This must be bankrupt, this is lie.

**Mr. Navaro****: **Bubble.

**Miles Guo****: **Bubble.  Also sir, you the book, you before the book, you talk already, China after is the world disaster economy, is the damage the world.  You said it many years ago.  You’re in the Brooklyn University say, CCP still we’re big enemy. You.  That’s why all Chinese love you.  And Steve Bannon, before I met him, I know Bannon is master. He knows the global vision, economy about the CCP, everything.

Then, this is why like Mike Pompeo, Mike Pompeo knows exactly all the American troubles found main the reason in the China CCP.  That’s evil.  CCP definitely is trying to take down the America economy, steal the money, also they want to change America everything. that’s why you as American hero, and Pompeo, and Steve Bannon, the global heroes.  You rescued the world, not just for America.  I know this, I’m from China, I don’t need any money.  Before I have in China 1.3 billion, is the big company.  We have 100 billion assets confiscated.  In one deal, they penalize my family trust, is 13 billion dollar cash they took.

We don’t need money, we work for the money. But American trouble is the Wall Street, they’re driven by profit, they only work for money.  They sold America.  Pension Funds, first is you know I talked to Steve Bannon, and Kyle Bass, and also what’s this guy, the CEO?   We together talked to …

**Mr. Bannon****: **oh, Scot Russell

**Miles Guo****: **Yeah, Scot Russell.  I said, CCP try, you know they under-the-table corruption to American pension funds CEO.  They take the money, they want to kill American old person.  Everything Miles you’re a lair, you’re crazy. You’re the raper guy, you lair guy, you roamer guy, you gossip.  I don’t care how  they talk about me.  I just care how can I tell the truth the West world.

You have the dark time now, very big dark power from China, the CCP.  Then, December 2019, and January 2020, I was with Steve Bannon together broadcast saying, China has prepared biology weapon and chemical weaponry to take down America.  Everything’s happened now, right?

That’s sir, you’re seriously, you don’t understand, you don’t know then, him knows. Steve knows.  Steve Bannon always with me together, You’re exactly the hero for 1.4 billion Chinese people.  Every one with common sense knows that you’re a big help for us. Mike Pompeo is a big help for us. Also President Trump.  You last minute you made the Xinjiang genocide, that’s big help for China and Chinese. and wake up all the global good people, just people.  I really appreciate you.

**Mr. Bannon****: **We do with Miles, follow up on it is that I’d like to say, two minutes into the Biden administration, two minutes afternoon, high noon on the 20th, the Chinese Communist Party sanctioned Pompeo, Putinger, Navarro, and Bannon.

**Miles Guo****: **Putinger also is China’s hero.

**Mr. Navaro****: **By the way, the only  person not in the government at the time, giving me honour being sanctioned by the CCP was Steven K. Bannon.  That’s how dangerous this man is.

**Miles Guo: **That’s why you created the New Federal State.

**Mr. Bannon****: **By the way, I do aware it’s a badge of honor, but that’s why I particularly incentivized to take down the CCP.  I cannot ever return till China until they take them down, as Miles knows I wanna retire in Hong Kong.

**Mr. Navaro****: **I guarantee Steve and I are not planning any casino trips in Macao.  That would not be happening.

**Miles Guo****: **You know Steve Bannon’s girlfriend is a beautiful, beautiful lady.  Beautiful lady. You know, she is always waiting Steve Bannon, when to take down the CCP, with me go to the Hong Kong Taiping mountain?

Mr. Bannon的女朋友非常漂亮，非常非常漂亮，她等待着班农能赢得干倒共产党的这一仗， 跟我们一起，去香港太平山。

Rachel andNana, you can ask more the question with Bannon, please.  Don’t nervous. Don’t nervous, this our family.  we are brother, ok, brother and sister so don’t be nervous.  Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon are real people.  In person, this is very gentleman, very is true-color, don’t be nervous, please, any question can ask.  Also about girlfriend, anything can ask.  问吧。没听声音，Nana。没声音。现在可以了。

Nana声音不清

**Mr. Navaro****：**We need Donal Trump back at the White House to do that.  We were on the verge of tearing down the firewall.  I actually worked on an executive order which would have sanctioned any American company that helped in any way maintaining the Chinese firewall, and Xi probably know that it’s criminal that American companies CISCO, YAHOO, Google, Microsoft, these American companies are complicit in helping to build and maintain that firewall.  Mark Zuckerberg himself praised the Chinese firewall, he actually used, this is criminal on Zuckerberg’s part, he actually hired Chinese Communist Party members who had a skill set in censoring the good people of China.  So, you don’t change, requires people who make those changes.  if we get Trump back at the White House sooner, rather than later, then that’s the kind of thing we need to do.  my view is that Twitter, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, CISCO, these are the American tech companies, they need to be held accountable for the great firewall of China, which is created  the greatest digital or wireless prison in history.

**Mr. Bannon****:  **Your question also is that since we did;t move hard and fast enough to help stop this outrageous collusion, and that’s what it is, collusion, of American tech companies oligarchs with the criminal organization, the CCP, to basically digitally imprison the Chinese people, Laobaixing.  Now, we have a firewall in America, we have a firewall in America, we have a firewall with the same tech oligarchs, because the American political class fought Trump and fought Navarro in the corporate interests of America, wouldn’t let us go after them and stop their enslavement of the Chinese people. And a lesson for the American people if you do… that’s why if you bounded us together, the Chinese people, the Laobaixing’s freedom is inextricably linked to the freedom of the American people, inextricably linked.  We’re partners in this, because we didn’t force those oligarchs to stop working with the criminal organization that enslaved the Chinese people, now we’re partially enslaved.  There’s a firewall here in United States.  Donal Trump is not on tour racing, GETTR didn’t even exist, because of the firewall.  That is the lesson for the world.  The enslavement of the Chinese people is not just the Chinese people’s problem, it’s the world’s problem.  Because the whole world financial organization and corporate organization is partners with the enslavement.

Remember, the slave labor of China drives the entire world economic system.  They want the lower wages, do the slave labor of the hard work of the Chinese people, and they take that value that’s created, and the CCP skim some off the top themselves, and then distribute the rest of it to the partners.  And they also keeps the wages down to working people throughout the world.  That’s not a conspiracy, that’s the way the system works.  The reason we didn’t take down the firewall is very simple, Wall Street and the corporations, and the oligarchs, and the silicon valley didn’t want to take them down and put enormous pressure on the Trump administration not to do it, and not have these executive orders signed.

And in their enslavement, now American  people see how we are enslaved.  That’s the lesson.  The lesson is the freedom of the Chinese people is the most important act of the first half of this century.  And until the Chinese people are free, nobody’s free.  So it’s in the self-interests of every person on earth to make sure they assist the Chinese people to take down this transnational criminal organization.

**Nana:**

**Eric:**

**Mr. Bannon****: **What happened in Afghanistan one of the most, if not the most important geopolitical thing that happened in the first half of the century.  Here’s why.  The control of the Eurasian landmass, which is central to the hegemony or the control of the world, is what the Chinese Communist Party trying to do. They don’t care about the economic, they don’t care about the wealth of the Chinese people, they gonna take that wealth and spread it out through out the rest of the world for control.  And now as a gangster regime, they got other gangster partners, North Korea, Pakistan, the mullahs  in Iran, Erdogan in Turkey and Putin in Russia, and a terrorist superstate in Afghanistan, with three groups that American men and women in their 20s, our servicemen, ten thousand, gave their lives in defeat, Taliban, ISIS, and Al-Qaeda, which we all defeated on the battlefield ten years ago.  And then crashed the caliphate troops, Trump crashed the ISIS in 18 months, which physically Obama said would take us generations, crashed in 18 months. We defeated those on battlefields, and now we’re in a situation where illegitimate gangster regimes and criminals now working as a global mafia in the first order of business, as it consolidate the Eurasian landmass.  And turn essentially everybody into the same slave labour as the Chinese people.  And the part of that is to … the western flank is to come in on India, with Burma, with CCP at the back of that, with a focus on the South China Sea and Taiwan.

And this is why, in this financial crisis, that is what you have in China right now, financial crisis.  A financial crisis that the little guy, the Laobaixing, the honest hardworking Chinese are being wiped out financially.  In order to get the eye off the ball of the people at the real estate come and say give me back my money, you’ve stolen my money, to say you’re gonna get it.  Now I believe, and the Global Time said it, now they gonna start moving on Taiwan, because they want to control those ships. So we’re heading towards, we’ve warned for years, the Chinese Communist Party is at War, it’s at war with the Chinese people, it’s at war with the West, information and cyber war, and economic war, and now we’re rapidly sliding to a kinetic war.  I believe with the factlessness and helplessness of the Biden regime, the way they Kowtow to the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party couldn’t be more rude and arrogant, and they publicly displays a complete disdain for this administration, for its weakness.  ’Cause they’re like wolves, they smell weakness, and this is a weak, afraid regime, not like Trump, that they know they won’t stand up, the they know that exactly like they abandoned the good people in Afghanistan, although we have to get out, we would get out, instead of doing it in a proper way and keep Bagram airbase and making sure our allies we are working with are taken care of, just run out in the night like a coward.

The CCP knows and tells the Taiwan people, they didn’t stand up for Hong Kong, they didn’t stand up for Afghanistan, they will stand up for you? They are not.  They’re gonna run.  And once they take Taiwan, with those chip design, the American economy is gonna implode.  And so, we are heading on a path of war because of why, the weakness of the West, the timidity of the West, the cowardliness of the West, beside every opportunity to stand up to these guys, and they only understand force, they only understand smash-mouth, and we still have the ability, technologically and financially, to crash them.  And the reason we are not, is we’ve been sold out by the city of London and Wall Street, and the financial institutions throughout the world, and the global corporations that don’t care about the slave labor of the Chinese people.  They’re in  partnership with them, and we’re rapidly heading to kinetic war, in the South China Sea, Taiwan, and in  the Kashmir, and India.  And who’s gonna die?  A lot of people’s gonna die.  You know who’s gonna die? Young Chinese are gonna die.  Young Chinese are being taken up into the military, they have no stake in this fight at all.  They’re gonna die because this regime, the supreme regime in Beijing.  There’s gonna be lots of Chinese young people dying in the battlefield.  There’s gonna be a lot of Indians to die in the battlefield.  There’s gonna be a lot of Americans to die in the battlefield.We’re gonna have major casualties of young people, their lives thrown away.  Why? Because we have criminal entities in Korea, in China, in Pakistan, in Persia, in Tehran, in Iran, in Turkey, and in Russia, and the West is too weak to stand up to it. and the price we’re gonna pay, is gonna dwarf what was paid in WWII, is gonna dwarf what was paid in WWI.  all because we haven’t learned the lesson. Until you stand up to these criminals, they are going to act like a Mafia axe, and they are going to continue to fight until they’re destroyed.  And that is why that is our mission.

**Eric: **no sound

**Racheal:**

**Mr. Navaro****: **We talked about this on War Room Pandemic, Steve showed quite extensively when the dictator Xi Jin Ping made his move on some tech companies, and we saw 400 billion dollars shaved in market cap from these firms.  And that was money lost to these pension funds here in American , and Steve made a great point, I mean it’s hard enough to get back subnormal returns in a year.  Let’s say you got a pension fund investing and you know it’s gonna earn a certain return so they can pay out their retirees as it goes forward in time. And if it misses that mark, it’s hard enough to get that back in the next year and years following. And you actually have a significant loss of your capital, the principal, you’ll never get it back, and so what it means, and the reason why Washington DC is not acting on it like it should, it’s a slow motion crisis with a very bad ending, so that we here in American are really facing in many places  pension-liability crisis, where the money will run out because these pension firms are underfunded.

By the way, this is all being exacerbated by world market conditions, where we had literally years of low interests, no interests trading environment where it’s very difficult for these pension companies to reform. Withe the Chinese Communist Party’s done already and is continuing to dos put American pension funds at extreme risk of default. It’s this argument that should be made literally every day in Washington for basically preventing the American pension funds from investing into Chinese Communist Party.  The worst part is you got US military retirees having their pension funds first being invested in the Chinese Communist Party.  This is got to stop, but as Steve said our elections have consequences, the stolen election has catastrophic consequences.

This is one of the many things that are play. I think Steve might have a few words in this as well.

**Mr. Bannon****: **No, I 100% agree.  One of the problem of allowing pension funds to finance basically the enslavement of the Chinese people, it’s obscene.  And now, at a stroke of a pen, Xi can eliminate masses amount of pension fund money.  But remember, It’s got a commonality, Xi doesn’t care, Xi doesn’t care besides control the tech CEO and wipes out working class people’s pensions in United States, they don’t care about the United States people, because they don’t care about their own Chinese people.  What’s happening right now in Evergrande and every Chinese company like that, is an entire generation of Chinese, who worked very hard but make very little, but carved out, because there’s no social safety net that save 50cents for every dollar, and want to as a good household and good citizen and put it to work and put it in a good company and get a return on it.  They are not looking to be filthy rich off this, but just save it and put it away

**Mr. Navaro****: **Vaccine companies?here’s what I find interesting, I go back I should mention I have this book just come out in Trump time. It’s available for pre-order on Amazon. In that, I talked a lot about how back in February 2020, we saw the CCP virus   was coming, and there’s likely going to be a pandemic.  See, Bannon here in January 2020 actually name the show called War Room Pandemic.  This was 2 months before the World Health Organization.

**Mr. Bannon****:** That’s because of Miles Guo, and we could not broadcast that show in China.  We were watch Peter Navarro in the East Room signing the China Deal.  At the same time, the virus is breaking out.

**Mr. Navaro****: **And here’s the point, when I was writing these memos to the White House Task Force, We thought about attacking the pandemic with a 5 vector strategy. One of them was the vaccine, we hope we could get more and more vaccine.  But there’re also other things in plane, including a therapeutics.  Here’s the thing, most people who get the CCP virus have very low risk of death. For them, they should not and need not to do the vaccine, what they need though is early treatment uses therapeutics, and back in those memos in February 2020, we identified these therapeutics and they need to have them.  So, what happened was this was because of the big pharmaceutical companies making the vaccines, somehow the strategy morphed into a vaccine only strategy, and the federal government actually suppressed literally the use of therapeutics, like hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin.  They literally made it a crime for physicians to prescribe these  drugs, to help people.  If you take hydroxychloroquine for example, you’d got bad reputation, because of the smear campaign.  But if you administer that within the first 7days, you’re likely to survive and find everything being OK, build up strong on antibodies.

**Mr. Bannon****: **But, but, but, the first advocate of hydroxychloroquine is Miles Guo.  What it saved? Tens of millions of people.

**Mr. Navaro****: ** I in fact have a little story for you.  I was in the defence policy coordinator at the White House, I had 65 million tablets of hydroxychloroquine, and I was in the process of dispensing them around the United States of America, and the FDA and Fauci came in and issued a directive that basically shot hydroxychloroquine.  At the same, I didn’t understand why, but as it go forward in time, becoming clearer and clearer to me that the pharmaceutical companies all they want is to sell the vaccine.  So, in order to sell the vaccine, they have to suppress the use of the therapeutics.

So, I think this the circle we are in now. If you go to different countries around the world, there’s a lot of countries understand the therapeutics are important. But to your point, these vaccines, look, if you’re elderly, and/or you have comorbidity, get vaccinated.  But the problem is this thing has two qualities we call it leaky and non-durable. Leaky means that even if you get vaccinated you can still get the virus, so you saw that with the delta variant.  That’s not good.  Non-durable means that they only last for 4-6 months, so you have to get so-called booster shots.  But they are not even booster shots, because the original virus, Miles, it doesn’t exist anymore.

**Miles Guo****: **Yes, I agree.

**Mr. Navaro****:** It’s like …

**Mr. Bannon****: **What he said, Miles said there’s gonna be ten thousand of these.  Overtime you think you cured one they’re gonna drop another one out there.

**Mr. Navaro****: **So, you’re using a vaccine which is designed to defend you against the virus that no longer exist. The new mutation has a totally different name. So, the point is that the pharmaceutical companies are making a bunch of money on this.  The Biden regime, and Fauci in particular, criminal , is basing his whole reputation in administration on the vaccine saving the world when we know already that it won’t, and people are dying, and that’s the tragedy of it all.

**Mr. Bannon****: **Listen, I don’t, look, I don’t believe we are going to make any real progress if we don’t put this thing back of us.  Whatever vaccine, until you get into the Wuhan Lab, and see how exactly this thing…

**Mr. Navaro****: **Wuhan Lab is Bioweapon Lab, let’s be clear about that.

**Mr. Bannon****: **Bioweapon’s Lab. Think about this for a second, this is how little the transnational criminal organization, the Chinese Communist Party cares about its people who are the biggest victims, you know why? In a city of 14 million people, they put a P4, a pathogen 4, Laboratory that’s also a bioweapons lab, which is more dangerous than having a live nuclear weapons into the middle of a city. That’s how little respect they have for the Chinese people. Nothing more than that.  Until we get in there with a international consortium, and a big part of that should be the Chinese that have left in the diaspora that have left China, to go back with the Japanese and Americans and Europeans, Australians, and others, and get to the bottom of exactly how it was created, what aspects it has of it, everything, we are not really ever gonna pass this thing.  That’s why you’ve the mutations, and the scientist would all known that you could chase this messenger RNA in vaccines, until you build up hoard immunity, and building uno hoard immunity, you’re gonna lose a lot of people.  A lot of people are gonna die, and the process of getting natural hoard immunity, we are not getting to the bottom of this.

And look, of all the criticism given to Miles Guo, in the media like that, I say hey in January, or late December, in 19, he was telling there’s a SARS thing coming at us.  I came up here to New York city to do our traditional annual broadcast for 3 days of Chinese New Year, when Peter actually kind of started the first day in the East Wing of the huge signing ceremony.  Liu He led a whole delegation over there, and Miles telling me hey there’s not gonna be a Chinese New Year, and I said why.  Miles said they got a SARS plague coming out of Wuhan, they are about to shut down Hubei province which is the size of France, and they gonna quarantine Wuhan, which is 40%bigger than New York city,we have’t got pass that yet.  And until we do that, there will be incremental, small pieces of progress, but more devastation.  And the economic carnage we have’t even addressed with yet, the world keeps printing money and that is all gonna be devastations, part of that, the unattended consequences for theregime is the problem in Evergrande right now.  Part of the supply chains in China all completely busted.  Why? Companies like Mitsubishi, companies like Sumsung, I can’t deal with these guys anymore, this criminal organization could change anything, they look at the tech companies there and say they are going to decapitate the management, you can’t deal with criminals, cause they can change the rules on you. And the unattended consequences of them allowing this bioweapon out on the Chinese people first, is destroying the understructure, and the natural power of the Chinese economy.  And that’s what they are suffering, and that implosion with all the world debt, and how the regime try to save themselves, criminal partners are going to lead us into a world war.

People under the age of 30 years old in China, in India, up in Kashmir, in the South China Sea and Taiwan, and the United States of America are all gonna die. Violent death for no reason than we didn’t stand up to a bunch of criminals and allowed people in the West to make money.

I want to be brutally frank about what this is about, that’s what this is about.  And history’s gonna judge all of us, all of us, on what we did at this time to stop that.

**Miles Guo****: **I could win.  This time I see Steve Bannon and me meeting together every day 3 to 4 times call you about the COVID, give you the intelligence.  everything give you information. You call back, I give you update what’s going on in China. You’re a big hero in America, You’re the first people, government high rank can help the people.

That’s why I know, I could be a good witness, 2020, January, February with Bannon we phone call many times.

**Mr. Bannon****: **That 65 million you had one time, …65 million hydroxychloroquine…

**Mr. Navaro****: **Let me do a math for you OK? It’s a $12 drug for a full 7-day treatment, about 14-15 tablets, like 50 cents a piece, right?  So, 65 million tablets, would have been able to treat 4 million infected Americans in early treatment use.

**Miles Guo****: **That’s genocide. 
**Mr. Bannon****: **Genocide.

**Miles Guo****:** Yes, absolutely genocide.

**Mr. Navaro****: **If you assume up to 70% reduction in mortality rate, which is what the science teaches us right now.  That’s 20 to 40 to 50 thousand dead right now because of that Tony Freaking Fauci.

**Miles Guo****: **Not only that.

**Mr. Bannon****:  **That’s as many as we lost in Vietnam by the way.  12 or 10 years of war in Vietnam, we lost 50 thousand.

**Mr. Navaro****:** On the head of this building here used to be where the tower for news networks was. CNN, right?

**Miles Guo****:** CNN’s here and CNN here, now CNN go out.

**Mr. Bannon****: **coward CNN

**Mr. Navaro****:** And CNN was a willing accomplice with Fauci in suppressing the use of hydroxychloroquine.  It’s described in what I called the In Trump Time book that’s coming out, hydroxy hysteria, they formed in many this hydroxy hysteria.  If you look back at it now, you say old people are gonna die if you use hydroxychloroquine, nobody died.  And there’s plenty of people using hydroxychloroquine, how many people died who have’t used it? So, over 4 million people worldwide, over 600 thousand Americans, and who knows how many people died in communist China, because the government ain’t talking.

**Miles Guo: **More than 10 million I believe. But I don’t believe also American 600 thousand people.  I don’t believe it.

**Mr. Bannon: **You mean many more.

**Miles Guo: **I think more.

**Mr. Bannon:** I think so. Just like China, just have 3 thousand died in China

**Miles Guo: **Now, the COVID, you know, the vaccine is worse than the COVID. You know the vaccine can kill many people, real mask you can see, all the street, the parent driving the car, immediately by accident die because of the COVID vaccine.  That’s the more major murder.

**Mr. Navaro****: **The most dangerous part of the vaccine for the world, and we just brought here for you the work of Dr. Malone on the Steve show, Dr. Malone was the direction in vein detect technology, he created the vaccine.  The problem is when you the vaccine for the CCP virus, you basically use spike protein, and it’s a custom-tailored vaccine that only deals with a portion of the over all disease, and it’s palsy universal vaccination, if you universally vaccinated everybody, we know from virology that if we mutation away from that universal vaccination, and thereby the danger is creating a super-virus.

**Miles Guo****: **You know every vaccine shot contains 40 trillion units inside. Who can tell you what is inside 40 trillion go to your DNA.  I ask everybody, Could you tell me where from the COVID?You don’t know where from the COVID, how can you make the antibody  vaccine? When you take the vaccine , you take the responsibility. You don’t take responsibility. You want people take the vaccine, you want people take 40 trillion, that’s crazy.  That’s why I ask all the people, to the Middle East, one prince and one princess, they call me: uncle Miles, I love you.  I say, do you take vaccine? Oh I take 5 shots, 5 shot.  Everybody take 5 shots. I asked, why? Because I’m rich I can take 5 shots, I want to try 6 shot.   One shot 40 trillion pieces.  I say, you 5 shots, it’s 200 trillion pieces put in your body.  I say you waiting next year bring you to the cemetery 100%.  That’s the crazy.

**Mr. Navaro****:** Dangerous, WE’re in very dangerous path now, very dangerous.

**Miles Guo****: **Sir, you many years ago talks the CCP is the global threat, terrorism.You taught this.

**Mr. Navaro****:** You know this, in 2006 I wrote the Coming China War.  In that book, I predicted that there would be a pandemic created by China.  I predicted that in 2006, I talked about that in the book In Trump Time. That’s why I was sitting in the meeting in January 15, 2020, with the President, and knowing what you told Steve everything, and I’m like very very fearful about what ’s about to happen.

**Mr. Bannon****: **Just want to make sure, In Trump Time— My Journal of the Plague Year, We should get the cover, we want all Chinese to own this book, and see what really happened.

**Miles Guo: **大家要记住啊，我们的彼得Mr. Navaro啊，（对纳瓦罗）I’ll talk your book.  兄弟姐妹们，我们的彼得纳瓦罗有一个新的书。  你们可以找到新书的名字吗？给放出来。我希望我们的战友们都去买我们的彼得纳瓦罗的书。What’s the name?

**Mr. Bannon****, ****Mr. Navaro****: **IN-TRUMP-TIME.

**Miles Guo****: **In Trump Time 在川普的时间里，In Trump Time

**Mr. Navaro****：**What it means is we had a culture in the White House where “in Trump time” means fast, and efficient. If we do something in Trump time, Jason Miller was saying we do it in 3 days that would be in Trump time; if yu take 6 days instead that is not in Trump time. So we do things in Trump time.

**Mr. Bannon****: **In Trump Time — My Journal of the Plague Year. Dr. Peter Navarro is amazing. I just want to add one thing in summary about the meeting.  There’s the book. the cover right there, thank you.

**Miles Guo****:** Oh, Here, here.

**Mr. Bannon****: **So beautiful, look at that.  Ain’t that great? It’s on Amazon, please order it.

**Mr. Navaro****: **Miles is in chapter one.

**Mr. Bannon****: **Yeah, Miles is … you got a… Ain’t that power? Ain’t that power?

Miles Guo: That’s a real American man.  Real american man.  That’s why you sir real American man.  American man in all the government now is Justice, big boss.  Look now, too many weird men, is no fight back.  CCP want kill your family, CCP steal your job, CCP steal your money, why you don’t fight back? You kowtow with CCP for small money.  You lose the future, you lose your family.  You are only true-color American real man. I love the book.  大家都要去买这书啊。No on the market the book?

**Mr. Bannon****: **No, no, you go to Amazon, go to Amazon.

**Miles Guo****:** 哦，对，亚马逊买啊，

**Mr. Bannon****:** go to Amazon and order it right now.

**Miles Guo: **Amazon，亚马逊 ，Amazon，Amazon，OK。We want to translate this into Chinese and Japanese.  8.9 million now.

**Mr. Bannon****: **We will get this book for you.

**Miles Guo****:** 8.9 this is outside, not inside.

**Mr. Bannon****: **We will get this book translated into Mandarin, and to Cantonese, and to Japanese.  Quickly.

**Miles Guo****: **说到这儿，Last question, and then we’re finish today the broadcast.  I really honoured you coming, I really honour Mr.. Steve.

**Mr. Navaro**: Honoured to be here.

**Mr. Bannon**: Honoured to be here.

**Miles Guo****: **I’m really honoured.   Now ever, you representative, ambassador…

**Mr. Navaro****:** George Washington.

**Mr. Bannon****:** George Washington of the Chinese people, of China.

**Miles Guo****:** No, no, no, I’m just small guy.  (to Bannon)This is my master, (to Navarro) now is my master. Brothers. So, you are the ambassador to the New Federal State

**Mr. Navaro****:** Yes.

**Miles Guo****: **I want to make the New Federal State really happen.  Also you are the representative, the ambassador for GETTR.

**Mr. Navaro****: **Yes.

**Miles Guo****:  **So, This is the killer to the Twitter.

**Mr. Bannon****: **Twitter-killer.

**Miles Guo****: **Twitter-killer. So, my masters, also Jason Miller.  I hope soon we can see Mike Pompeo, Putinger, we’ll all together.  That’s the real American men.  We need fight back.  You don’t know how many Chinese love you,  really appreciate you.

**Mr. Bannon****: **We love the Chinese.

**Miles Guo****: **You look at the people, China’s Mainland now this is midnight, 3 or 4 o’clock , China’s with no sleep they are here. and many people you know they are here. That’s outside, nearly 9 million.  I think inside more than 70 million, maybe more than 100 million people watch.

**Mr. Bannon****:** We all love the Chinese people.

**Miles Guo****: ** That’s big, that’s big, sir.  In America now, everybody work for money, We the New Federal State, work for justice.  We want take down the CCP.  We seriously want to take down the CCP.

So, Everybody, we really appreciate the team today is the good job.  This is job so good.  Same the Afghani’s the level. Our broadcast same the Afghani’s level. Too great job, but we are you know, we are only for the world to know the truth.  Technically, no important.  So really appreciate.

Where’s Rachel? Where is Nana, Eric? I really like Rachel, Nana, and Eric ask questions, beautiful. Last minute, you can ask one question, everybody some questions, then we finish today’s live-stream.  Thank you.

**Eric:**

**Mr. Bannon****: **I think definitely we will have it some time after 2024 when Trump takes the White House back. I think the earliest would be, because the Biden administration will never  do that.  Even when we take back the House in 2022, we’ll take back the House, it will be after 2024.  But you know what? Let’s take down the CCP before the New Federal States got…

**Mr. Navaro****: **You know what? Let’s take Trump back to the White House before 2024.  They stole our election.  This man is working on the forensic audit, decertification of election in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania,

**Mr. Bannon****: **Off the Navarro Report.

**Mr. Navaro****:** Wisconsin, and we can’t wait for 2024.  The country is falling apart.

**Mr. Bannon****: **I agree.

**Eric:**

**Racheal****:**

**Mr. Bannon****: **Thank you very much. Thank you.

**Miles Guo****: **Nana

**Nana****:**

**Mr. Bannon****: **I think it shows no matter what CCP does, it can’t take down the movement, the Whistleblower Movement, the New Federal State of China, the rule of low, GTV and GNews, are 5 times bigger than a year ago.  Here’s what I think is very sad, is because this CCP put some people involve in that it caused a lot of rockets. The Chinese people are not gonna get a chance to participate at least initially i the great worth of GNews and GTV.  Remember, these are news operations are the voice of the free China, the new China and the new Chinese.  So hopefully that will all worked out over time. because wee wanna make sure that the Chinese people prosper, when they have the opportunity to prosper.  So, for me it’s a shame that the CCP was able to get involved on this thing in the margined caused a lot of rockets, so going forward, I think we got to be very careful, have the guard to take down everything, including any opportunity that the Chinese people get any prosperity.  That was the one thing of the five yokes: keep them too hungry, too hard of work, no free time in their hand, no ability to have any type of wealth creation.  You know, treat them like slaves, and that just shows you the Chinese Communist Party’s mentality.  Hopefully, we will work through that.

**Miles Guo: **You know, finally, last night, I have the big conference call with the GTV investors in Europe, they say before we moved out the chairman is the Bannon, now we need Bannon back maybe.  I said yes this is a good suggestion. Cannon is the GTV’s chairman, founder.  with too much political, you know recently we move the chairman out.  But maybe we’ll remove back. Now this is the miracle, nobody believe we can settle with SEC.  It’s CCP use warfare legally,

**Mr. Bannon****: **Law fare.

**Miles Guo****: **Law fare is the Arizona, But SEC, Bannon is doing a good job.  They don’t penalty with GTV, Saraca.  they just settle, give them money.  30 million not big money, OK.  but this is very important, our investors, 100%, only ten people get back money, 99.9% still want to invest back. That’s unbelievable!  This is my big honour.  Another one,  yesterday, we have the conference call, the valuation of GTV is 60 billion dollar.  Before is 2 billion dollar, so obeyer we got 30 times growth.  Another one, very important is the attorney James the lady, and her husband.  Nobody believes that James can settle, no more investigations, yesterday the lady made the decision, no penalty, zero.  I really, I really… I want to make the letter say the attorney James, the lady’s so great, also same like us, we are also not white people.  She’s the black people, I’m the asian, yellow people. This justice, I really appreciate. That’s a big honour, never happened in America.

**Mr. Bannon:** Yes.  What I do agree with Miles is I think it’s the time now to bring the “black-hand” of Bannon to the GTV. Thank you guys, thank you guys very much.

**Miles Guo****: **放音乐，咱们这就结束了，放音乐吧。谢谢了，Rachel，谢谢Nana，Eric. Thank you very much.

**All**: Take down the CCP ！

**Miles Guo: **好我们今天就直播到此，谢谢兄弟姐妹们，谢谢。

Thailand’s Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health have approved and announced the Pfizer vaccination program for students aged 12 to 18 starting from October. The program covers nearly five million students in public and private schools. Based on parental consent and voluntary principles, the program will vaccinate students firstly in the most strictly controlled 29 provinces. The new semester in Thailand in November will be the beginning of more vaccine disasters.

At the end of June, Thailand’s CDC and Pfizer signed a preliminary contract with the intention to purchase 20 million doses of Pfizer’s covid vaccine and an additional 10 million doses at the end of July. The CDC cooperates with the school to establish a vaccination center in the school, and the contracted Pfizer vaccine will cover this target group. The Chinese Communist Party’s Kexing vaccine is planned to be used in children over 3 years old. The covid vaccine produced by Oxford AstraZeneca in Thailand will also be shipped to other Southeast Asian countries. In August, the Ministry of Health of Thailand first recommended that children of that age with chronic diseases be vaccinated. Now the vaccine plan is fully rolled out. The Chinese government uses the covid vaccine to solve the problems of the old the weak the sick, and the disabled. So does Thailand.

According to the Whistleblowers’ Movement intelligence, Thailand is a disaster area corrupted by CCP’s blue-golden program. The Chia Tai Group is backed by the Jiang family and is a shareholder of Kexing and Pfizer. Early Kexing vaccine was questioned due to quality problems, and its promotion in Thailand was frustrated. The Thai government avoided the edge and purchased Pfizer vaccines with CCP background for students and government workers. No matter which covid vaccine, it cannot prevent the virus, and will bring serious side effects to the body, even life-threatening. Hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, artemisinin, and etc. are the drugs that prevent and treat the covid. We hope that the parents of students in Thailand can learn the truth as soon as possible and refuse to vaccinate their children.

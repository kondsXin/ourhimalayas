**Yesterday was another big day in the history of the New Federal of China (NFSC).  Mr. Peter Navarro publicly recognized the NFSC in the live broadcast on GTV. And as the person that President Trump trusted the most, he also officially joined the NFSC as our international ambassador.  **

- In addition to Mr. Navarro, two other world-famous powerful persons also joined us yesterday. However, they were unable to attend to go on live due to threats from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against their families and businesses.
- Mr. Navarro was the first to say, “CCP lied Americans died” and “Gettr is Twitter’s killer.”

**Two of the three important things Miles promised would happen within 90 days have already been accomplished. The first is these three great men joining the NFSC; the second is to receive a settlement agreement from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) without penalty clauses. The last surprise is on its way now.**

- Some people thought that what Miles was talking about is that the CCP can be destroyed in 90 days. And Miles wants these people to stop having such unrealistic fantasies.
- Unlike Liar Lude and his gang, the Whistleblower Movement (WM) is only talking about the present with what happened in the past. We will never give unrealistic promises.

**When one wants to criticize others, one should first ask if you are qualified to do so. Just like no one would believe someone from Afghanistan who says pork tastes terrible.**

- The eyes of a rat can see only an inch of light. CCP’s top leaders and its running dogs like Liar Lude are these rats that never see what the lions see.

**NY AG Letitia James** **is a rising political star. Miles believes that she most likely will be the future Governor of New York or Attorney General of the United States. **

**Tomorrow (September 17th) and Sunday (September 19th) at 9 a.m. EST, we will be live on GTV.  And tomorrow afternoon, there will be an online 100th birthday celebration for our oldest NFSC citizen Martin J. Bannon (Mr. Steve Bannon’s father).**

` MOSVIDEO` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/2593373/)

2022年5月6日，来自荷兰的摄影记者科普斯接受了妮可战友的采访。
 
On May 6, 2022, Guido Koppes, a photojournalist from the Netherlands, was interviewed by fellow fighter Nicole.
 
他是今天早上到达梅迪卡救援基地的，之前并不知道新中国联邦大帐篷，是被同事带来这里的。
 
He arrived at Medyka rescue base that morning. He did not know there is a large New Federal State of China (NFSC) tent until he was brought here by his colleague.
 
妮可向他介绍我们是消灭中共的新中国联邦人，中共是一切灾难的根源时，
 
When Nicole introduced him that we are the New Chinese who are taking down the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which is the root cause of all the disasters,
 
他表示出有一点点惊讶，他说现在想推翻中共政府的人肯定很多，
 
He expressed he was a little bit surprise. He said there are certainly many people who want to overthrow the CCP government now,
 
但由于中共打造的互联网防火墙，对新闻的严密审查，
 
but because of the Internet firewall the CCP has created, the tight censorship of the news,
 
以及用大量金钱收买西方资本家和境外主流媒体，让其闭嘴并配合执行对真相和事实的压制，导致人们对中共邪恶本质和中国人民的反抗了解很少。
 
and the large amounts of money used to buy off Western capitalists and the mainstream media outside of China to silence them and cooperate in enforcing the suppression of truth and facts, very few people understand the evil nature of the CCP and resist it.
 
他知道中共在香港的暴行和对新疆的种族灭绝，知道那里的反抗者已被中共当局大规模关押在监狱，
 
He is aware of the CCP’s atrocities in Hong Kong and the genocide in Xinjiang and knows that those who resist there have been massively imprisoned by the CCP authorities.
 
但他坚信中国人民的反抗最终一定会像海啸一样爆发出来！
 
But he is convinced that the resistance of the Chinese people will eventually explode like a tsunami!
 
当科普斯谈到全球的主流媒体大搞言论审查、掩盖事实真相时，
 
When Koppes talked about the global mainstream media’s big censorship of speech and cover-up of the truth,
 
愤愤地说有些大政府、大公司控制的主流媒体，钳制了言论自由，
 
he said indignantly that some big governments and corporations control the mainstream media, and in fact they are clamping down on people’s freedom of speech,
 
甚至在疫情期间只讨论和传播政府单方面的说法，
 
even allowing only the government’s unilateral claims to be discussed and disseminated during the pandemic.
 
这与中共国无异，简直是太荒唐了！他们本应探讨真相和讲述事实！
 
This is no different from the Chinese communist state, it’s ridiculous!
 
妮可进一步揭露中共对全球主流媒体的渗透，
 
Nicole further exposed the CCP’s infiltration of the global mainstream media.
 
在中共金钱的诱惑下，西方主流媒体完全放弃了本应有的道德操守，甘愿为中共干脏活。
 
Under the temptation of the CCP’s money, the mainstream media in the West have completely abandoned their proper moral integrity and are willing to do the dirty work for the CCP.
 
失去道德和信仰的资本主义是灾难性的，因为中共只需金钱便可轻而易举地控制西方媒体，进而控制你们西方人的言论自由。
 
Capitalism without morality and faith is disastrous because the CCP can easily control the Western media, and thus the freedom of expression of Westerners with just money.
 
我们在争取自己的自由时，也是在拯救你们的自由。
 
In fighting for our own freedom, we are also saving yours.
 
妮可向科普斯介绍了我们自己的媒体平台Gnews和盖特，
 
Nicole introduced Koppes to our own media platforms, Gnews and Gettr.
 
他完全认同妮可的观点，并表示大家在梅迪卡的行动就是与普京作战！
 
He totally agreed with Nicole and said that everyone’s actions in Medyka are fighting Putin!

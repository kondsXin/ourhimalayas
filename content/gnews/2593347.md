## 视频|美国司法部指控赌场大亨Steve Wynn充当中共代理人
` MOSVIDEO` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/2593347/)

5月17日，美国司法部在哥伦比亚特区地方法院对永利度假村前CEO Steve Wynn提起诉讼，
 
On May 17, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Columbia against Steve Wynn, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.
 
寻求一项声明性判决，即Wynn有义务根据《外国代理人登记法》(FARA)注册成为中共代理人，
 
The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment that Wynn is obligated to register as a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).
 
并指控他在2017年6月到8月应北京要求，分别在晚餐和电话中游说川普政府取消郭文贵先生的签证，协助中共将其遣返回中共国。
 
The court also alleges that he lobbied the Trump administration to cancel Miles Guo’s visa and assist the CCP in deporting him to the Communist China at Beijing’s request in separate dinner and telephone calls from June to August in 2017.
 
司法部在一份声明中称，Wynn是代表中共公安部前副部长孙力军向川普政府转达要求取消郭先生签证的，
 
In a statement, the DOJ said Wynn conveyed the request to the Trump administration to cancel Miles’ visa on behalf of Sun Lijun, the former vice minister of the CCP’s Ministry of Public Security.
 
并与白宫和国家安全委员会的高级官员多次讨论安排与孙力军等中共官员会面的问题。
 
He had many discussions with senior officials at the White House and the National Security Council about arranging meetings with Sun Lijun and other CCP officials.
 
但Wynn却辩解说“是为了保护自己在澳门的商业利益”，因为他的永利度假村在澳门经营着一家豪华酒店和一家赌场。
 
Wynn, however, argued that he was “protecting his business interests in Macau,” where his Wynn Resorts operates a luxury hotel and a casino.
 
美国安全部助理司法部长Matthew G. Olsen表示，当外国政府利用美国人身份作为其代理人来影响美国时，FARA给了美国人民知情权！
 
Assistant Attorney General for Security, Matthew G. Olsen, said FARA gives the American people the right to know when foreign governments use the identities of Americans as their agents to influence the United States!
 
司法部的民事诉讼还曾在2018年、2021年和2022年4月3次建议Wynn根据FARA注册为中共代理，但均被其拒绝了。
 
The Justice Department’s civil action also recommended Wynn register as a CCP agent under FARA on three separate occasions in 2018, 2021, and April 2022. But all have been rejected by Wynn.
 
Wynn的律师否认了这些指控，称自己从未担任过中共政府的代理人，
 
Wynn’s attorneys deny all these allegations, claiming that Wynn has never acted as an agent of the CCP government.
 
没有根据FARA进行注册的义务，
 
He has no obligation to register under FARA.
 
且不同意司法部对FARA的法律解释，并期待在法庭上证明他们的观点。
 
The attorneys disagree with the DOJ’s legal interpretation of FARA and expect to prove their points in court.
 
郭文贵先生在5月18日的盖特直播中提到，Elliott Broidy早已认罪，
 
Miles mentioned in a May 18th Gettr Live broadcast that Elliott Broidy had long since pleaded guilty.
 
至此当年川普的共和党总统竞选筹款委员会主席和副主席均被司法部起诉，
 
To date, both of the chairman and vice chairman of Trump’s Republican presidential campaign fundraising committee were sued by the DOJ.
 
这对接下来的灭共和美国肃清中共间谍是天大的喜讯。
 
This is great news for the next extermination and purging the spies of CCP in the United States.

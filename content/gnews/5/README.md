Faced with the increasingly tightening isolation and confrontation of the international community, the CCP’s finances are also headed for ruin. For four years now, through a series of precise exposures, the CCP has lost its credibility within China and among the international community. The CCP’s  $3 trillion foreign exchange reserves are about to dry up, more than $1 trillion of the #3 trillion foreign exchange is in U.S. Treasury bonds, leaving $2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, only $1 trillion of which can be used freely. However the minimal annual expenditures require about $700 to $800 BN on imports to sustain the native economy. Hong Kong, which is a treasure trove of foreign exchange for the CCP, has been destructed by the Xi’s administration.

During a live broadcast on GTV on September 14, Miles Guo said Xi Jinping is aware of the CCP’s $20 trillion worth of stolen “party assets” overseas. This is enough to keep the CCP alive for a few more decades. However, Xi absolutely has no control over these properties. Only a few families, such as Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Wang Qishan, and Zhu Rongji, have this information. Xi absolutely has no say in international finance. He has no more than 50 percent control over the CCP’s military.

The 20 trillion dollars of assets belonging to the Chinese people will become a wrestling battlefield for the three forces on the New Federal State of China(NFSC), the CCP proxies of the international evil organizations, and the Xi’s administration.

The coming up exposures from Miles will focus on Wang Qishan’s overseas assets and the overseas layouts of Wang, Zhu Rongji, Jiang Mianheng, and others. It will be including how Wang Qishan used his position to pocket the stolen money of Zhou Yongkang and Xu Caihou, and reported a fraction of it to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. The fight between Xi, Wang, and other forces over the $20 trillion is essentially a dogfight between dark forces like Russia. And the NFSC’s “getting back money in the air” actions is a perfect legitimate fight of wealth, dignity, and well-being of the Chinese people.

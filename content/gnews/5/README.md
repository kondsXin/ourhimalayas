**This time, the unrestricted economic and legal war launched by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against GTV ended in failure. Intellectuals, academics, and legal professionals in Communist China now must realize that the Whistleblower Movement (WM) and the New Federal State of China (NFSC) are the best in the world.**

**Nine-finger Goblin (Sara Wei), Liar Lude, and their gang are on their way to prison.**

- After the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made its announcement, Sara Wei and Liar Lude thought they could finally be relieved. However, the SEC only signed the settlement agreement for GTV and Saraka. Sara Wei’s VOG was not part of it.
- Sara Wei has confirmed on her YouTube Show that Liar Lude is a key management member of her Phoenix Farm.  The criminal investigation of them will not be finished.
- Those few people who sued us, including that CCP spy, Baldy Doudou, will also be investigated for filing false reports.

**Miles thanks the outstanding prosecutors from the Southern District of New York who has worked on this case. He especially expresses great appreciation to AG Letitia James for upholding the dignity of American law and not following the CCP’s lead. And Miles called her the pride of our minority.**

**The old GTV original shareholders did not lose their investments due to this lawsuit. And even with the interference of the ****CCP****, GTV’s stock has now appreciated 30 times in value.  Plus,** **WM has never stopped exposing the CCP’s evil deeds.**

- Many original shareholders suggested paying the fine to the SEC for GTV. Mile is very impressed (but he has repeatedly said that GTV will never take a penny out of WM warriors’ pockets).  And he would do anything for such fellow warriors.
- The Chinese people have never been so selfless and united, with such a global vision. We, the new Chinese, will collectively defend our reputation, our interests and earn legitimate money.
- This lawsuit has made us stronger and taught us how to use Western law to defend and protect our rights and interests.

**GTV’s case also gives us a clearer picture of the mainstream media’s ugly face.  Miles has nothing to do with GTV, but they use his name to headline their stories.**

- However, thanks to their “free commercials”, GETTR and GTV have recently gained a large number of subscribers.

**WM is now exterminating the CCP by revealing the dark secrets of vaccines. Some warriors are worried that**** speculators ****may feed on the fruits of our labor later.  Miles reminds everyone that we don’t even plant any fruits on the vaccine issue.**

**Miles will be live on GTV with Steve Bannon today starting at 2 p.m. ET.**

According to Global Network on September 15th, Zeguang Zheng, the new Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, originally received an invitation from the British Commons to attend a reception and deliver a speech on an open balcony of the house of the Parliament. But the day before the reception began, the Speakers of the House of Lords and House of Commons of the British Parliament made a decision at the same time to prohibit the CCP ambassador from entering the British Parliament.

China imposed sanctions on nine British politicians, lawyers and an academic in March for spreading “lie and false information” about the treatment of Uighur Muslims in the western part of the country. Seven MPs filed a complaint with the Parliament: “It would have been an insult to Parliament and to the principle of free speech upon which democracies are founded if the official representative of a regime which had just banned Parliamentarians from entering Chinese territory because they had stood up in the House of Commons to call out China’s appalling human rights abuses”.  The Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsey Hoyle, said that I think that when China imposes sanctions on some of our members, It is inappropriate for the Chinese ambassador to meet at our workplace in the House of Commons . “The Speaker of the House of Lords McFall said in a statement, “The speakers of both houses agreed that, taking into account the current sanctions on members, this China meeting should be held elsewhere. “

Recently, countries around the world have begun to say “no” to the CCP, including the United States recently stated that it is considering changing the name of Taiwan’s representative office in the United States to the “Taiwan Representative Office.” These actions greatly angered the CCP. Regarding the prohibition of the CCP’s ambassador from entering the British Parliament, the spokesperson of the CCP can only say that this decision reflects the narrow mentality of some people in the UK, and we despise and strongly condemn it.
